Having problems? Ask for help in the Exchange forums. Visit the forums at [Exchange Server](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=60612), [Exchange Online](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=267542), or [Exchange Online Protection](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=285351).

Microsoft® Exchange Server 2007 setup cannot continue because this server does not appear to belong to a valid Active Directory® directory service site.

Microsoft Exchange setup requires that the server that is used for installation of Exchange 2007 belong to a valid Active Directory site.

To resolve this issue, verify that the local server is a member of a valid Active Directory site and rerun Exchange Server 2007 setup.

You can use the **/DsGetSite** option of the Nltest.exe command line tool to verify and display site membership. For more information, see "Nltest.exe: NLTest Overview" in the "Tools and Settings Collection" of *Windows Server 2003 Technical Reference* ([https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=27734](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=27734)).
