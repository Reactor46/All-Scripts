# Create a recovery database

 

_**Applies to:** Exchange Server 2013_


You can use the Shell to create a recovery database, a special kind of mailbox database that's used to mount and extract data from the restored database as part of a recovery operation. After you create a recovery database, you can move a recovered or restored mailbox database into the recovery database, and then use the [New-MailboxRestoreRequest](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff829875\(v=exchg.150\)) cmdlet to extract data from the recovered database. After extraction, the data can then be exported to a folder or merged into an existing mailbox. Using recovery databases, you can recover data from a backup or copy of a database without disrupting user access to current data.

## Use the Shell to create a recovery database

This example creates the recovery database RDB1 on the Mailbox server MBX2.

```powershell
New-MailboxDatabase -Recovery -Name RDB1 -Server MBX2
```

This example creates the recovery database RDB2 on the Mailbox server MBX1 using a custom path for the database file and log folder.

```powershell
    New-MailboxDatabase -Recovery -Name RDB2 -Server MBX1 -EdbFilePath "C:\Recovery\RDB2\RDB2.EDB" -LogFolderPath "C:\Recovery\RDB2"
```

For detailed syntax and parameter information, see [New-MailboxDatabase](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa997976\(v=exchg.150\)).

## How do you know this worked?

To verify that you've successfully created a recovery database, do the following:

  - In the Shell, run the following command to display configuration information for the recovery database.
    
    ```powershell
    Get-MailboxDatabase <RecoveryDatabaseName> | Format-List
    ```

## Other Tasks

After you create a recovery database, you may also want to restore data using a recovery database. For detailed steps, see [Restore data using a recovery database](restore-data-using-a-recovery-database-exchange-2013-help.md).
