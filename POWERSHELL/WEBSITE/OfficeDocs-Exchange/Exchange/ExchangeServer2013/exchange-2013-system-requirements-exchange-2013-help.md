# Exchange 2013 system requirements

 

_**Applies to:** Exchange Server 2013_


Learn about the Exchange 2013 requirements that you need to know before you install Exchange 2013. For example, you’ll learn about the hardware, network, and operating system requirements.

Before you install Microsoft Exchange Server 2013, we recommend that you review this topic to ensure that your network, hardware, software, clients, and other elements meet the requirements for Exchange 2013. In addition, make sure you understand the coexistence scenarios that are supported for Exchange 2013 and earlier versions of Exchange.

## Supported coexistence scenarios

The following table lists the scenarios in which coexistence between Exchange 2013 and earlier versions of Exchange is supported.

1   If you want to create an EdgeSync Subscription between an Exchange 2007 Hub Transport server and an Exchange 2013 SP1 Edge Transport server, you need to install Exchange 2007 SP3 Update Rollup 13 or later on the Exchange 2007 Hub Transport server.

2   If you want to create an EdgeSync Subscription between an Exchange 2010 Hub Transport server and an Exchange 2013 SP1 Edge Transport server, you need to install Exchange 2010 SP3 Update Rollup 5 or later on the Exchange 2010 Hub Transport server.

## Supported hybrid deployment scenarios

Exchange 2013 supports hybrid deployments with Office 365 tenants that have been upgraded to the latest version of Office 365. For more information about specific hybrid deployments, see [Hybrid deployment prerequisites](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh534377\(v=exchg.150\)).

1   Windows Server 2012 R2 is supported only with Exchange 2013 SP1 or later.

2   Windows Server 2012 R2 forest functionality mode is supported only with Exchange 2013 SP1 or later.

## Directory server architecture

The use of 64-bit Active Directory domain controllers increases directory service performance for Exchange 2013.


> [!NOTE]
> In multi-domain environments, on Windows Server 2008 domain controllers that have the Active Directory language locale set to Japanese, your servers might not receive some attributes that are stored on an object during inbound replication. For more information, see Microsoft Knowledge Base article 949189, <A href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=3052&kbid=949189">A Windows Server 2008 domain controller that is configured with the Japanese language locale may not apply updates to attributes on an object during inbound replication</A>.



## Installing Exchange 2013 on directory servers

For security and performance reasons, we recommend that you install Exchange 2013 only on member servers and not on Active Directory directory servers. However, you can't run DCPromo on a computer running Exchange 2013. After Exchange 2013 is installed, changing its role from a member server to a directory server, or vice versa, isn't supported.

## Hardware

The recommended hardware requirements for Exchange 2013 servers vary depending on a number of factors including the server roles that are installed and the anticipated load that will be placed on the servers.

For detailed information on how to properly size and configure your deployment, see [Exchange 2013 Sizing and Configuration Recommendations](exchange-2013-sizing-and-configuration-recommendations-exchange-2013-help.md).

For information about deploying Exchange in a virtualized environment, see [Exchange 2013 virtualization](exchange-2013-virtualization-exchange-2013-help.md).
