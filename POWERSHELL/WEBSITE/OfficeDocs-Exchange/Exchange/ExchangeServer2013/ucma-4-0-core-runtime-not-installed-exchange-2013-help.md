# UCMA 4.0, Core Runtime not installed

 

_**Applies to:** Exchange Server_


Microsoft Exchange Server 2013 Setup can’t continue because the local computer requires a software update. You’ll need to install this update before Exchange 2013 Setup can continue.

Exchange 2013 Setup requires that the Unified Communications Managed API 4.0 Runtime update be installed on the computer before installation can continue.

Download and install the 64-bit update from the following URL, and then click **retry** on the **Readiness Checks** page.


> [!NOTE]
> If this update requires a reboot to complete installation, you’ll need to exit Exchange 2013 Setup, reboot, and then start Setup again.
