# Import and export custom greetings, announcements, menus, and prompts

 

_**Applies to:** Exchange Server 2010 Service Pack 2 (SP2), Exchange Server 2013_


You can import and export the audio files that you’ve recorded to use on Unified Messaging (UM) dial plans and auto attendants. For example, you might want to export and save a copy of an audio file if you’re upgrading from a previous version of Exchange. Or, you might need to import a copy of a recorded audio prompt before configuring a dial plan or auto attendant.

The audio files are used for the following purposes:

  - On UM dial plans, audio files are used for customized welcome greetings and informational announcements. They’re played when Outlook Voice Access users call in to an Outlook Voice Access number.

  - On UM auto attendants, audio files are used for customized non-business and business hours greetings, informational announcements, menu prompts, and navigation menus. They’re played when callers call in to a UM auto attendant.

The following audio file formats are supported for custom greetings, announcements, menus, and prompts:

  - .wma files encoded with Windows Media Audio 9.2 - 96 kbps/44 kHz/stereo 1-pass CBR (Windows Sound Recorder)

  - Windows Media Audio Voice 9 - 8 kbps/8 kHz/Mono, and .wav files encoded with the Linear PCM (16 bit/sample), 8 kilohertz (kHz) audio codec

You import the audio files that are used by UM dial plans and auto attendants into the system mailbox named {e0dc1c29-89c3-4034-b678-e6c29d823ed9} and export the audio files from this system mailbox. The audio files can be imported and exported by using the **Import-UMPrompt** and **Export-UMPrompt** cmdlets.

For additional management tasks related to UM auto attendants, see [UM auto attendant procedures](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/exchange/voice-mail-unified-messaging/automatically-answer-and-route-calls/um-auto-attendant-procedures).

## What do you want to do?

## Use the Shell to import custom greetings, announcements, menus, and prompts for UM dial plans and auto attendants

This example imports the welcome greeting file named welcomegreeting.wav from d:\\UMPrompts into the UM dial plan `MyUMDialPlan`.

```powershell
    [byte[]]$c = Get-content -Path "d:\UMPrompts\welcomegreeting.wav" -Encoding Byte -ReadCount 0
    Import-UMPrompt -UMDialPlan MyUMDialPlan -PromptFileName "welcomegreeting.wav" -PromptFileData $c
```

This example imports the welcome greeting file named welcomegreeting.wav from d:\\UMPrompts into the UM auto attendant `MyUMAutoAttendant`.

```powershell
    [byte[]]$c = Get-content -Path "d:\UMPrompts\welcomegreeting.wav" -Encoding Byte -ReadCount 0
    Import-UMPrompt -UMAutoAttendant MyUMAutoAttendant -PromptFileName "welcomegreeting.wav" -PromptFileData $c
```

## Use the Shell to export custom greetings, announcements, menus, and prompts from UM dial plans and auto attendants

This example exports the welcome greeting for the UM dial plan `MyUMDialPlan` and saves it as the file named welcomegreeting.wav.

```powershell
    $prompt = Export-UMPrompt -PromptFileName "customgreeting.wav�? -UMDialPlan MyUMDialPlan
    set-content -Path "d:\DialPlanPrompts\welcomegreeting.wav" -Value $prompt.AudioData -Encoding Byte
```

This example exports the business hours welcome greeting for the UM auto attendant `MYUMAutoAttendant` and saves it as the file named BusinessHoursWelcomeGreeting.wav.

```powershell
    $prompt = Export-UMPrompt -BusinessHoursWelcomeGreeting -UMAutoAttendant MyUMAutoAttendant
    set-content -Path "d:\UMPrompts\BusinessHoursWelcomeGreeting.wav" -Value $prompt.AudioData -Encoding Byte
```
