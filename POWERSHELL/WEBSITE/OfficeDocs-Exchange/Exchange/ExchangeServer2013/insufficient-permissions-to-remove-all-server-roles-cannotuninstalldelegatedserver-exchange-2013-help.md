The content in this topic hasn't been updated for Microsoft Exchange Server 2013. While it hasn't been updated yet, it may still be applicable to Exchange 2013. If you still need help, check out the community resources below.

Having problems? Ask for help in the Exchange forums. Visit the forums at [Exchange Server](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=60612), [Exchange Online](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=267542), or [Exchange Online Protection](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=285351).

Microsoft Exchange Server 2007 setup cannot continue because the attempt to uninstall all server roles failed.

Exchange 2007 setup requires that the user who is logged on when uninstalling all server roles be a member of the Exchange Organization Administrators groups, or the Enterprise Admins group.

To resolve this issue, grant the logged-on user Exchange Organization Administrator permissions or enroll them in the Enterprise Admins group, or log on with an account that has those permissions and rerun Exchange 2007 setup.
