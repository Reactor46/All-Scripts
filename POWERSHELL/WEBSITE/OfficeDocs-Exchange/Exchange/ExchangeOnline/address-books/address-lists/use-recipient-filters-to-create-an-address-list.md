# Create an address list by using recipient filters

This topic explains how to create an address list by using recipient filters. To learn more about address lists, see [Address lists](address-lists.md). 
  
For additional management tasks related to address lists, see [Managing Address Lists](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/44c87349-964b-4700-9ce9-87bd4cb2249e.aspx).
  
## What do you need to know before you begin?

- Estimated time to complete each procedure: 5 minutes.
    
- You need to be assigned permissions before you can perform this procedure or procedures. To see what permissions you need, see the "Address lists" entry in the [Email Address and Address Book Permissions](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/1c1de09d-16ef-4424-9bfb-eb7edffbc8c2.aspx) topic. 
    
- By default in Exchange Online, the Address List role isn't assigned to any role groups. To use any cmdlets that require the Address List role, you need to add the role to a role group. For more information, see the "Add a role to a role group" section in the topic, **Manage role groups**.
    
- To use the _RecipientFilter_ parameter to create a custom filter, you must specify a string for the filter. The Exchange Online PowerShell uses OPATH for the filtering syntax. OPATH is a querying language designed to query object data sources. 
    
- You can't use the Exchange admin center (EAC) to perform this procedure. You must use Exchange Online PowerShell.
    
- For information about keyboard shortcuts that may apply to the procedures in this topic, see [Keyboard shortcuts for the Exchange admin center](../../accessibility/keyboard-shortcuts-in-admin-center.md).
    
> [!TIP]
> Having problems? Ask for help in the Exchange forums. Visit the forums at [Exchange Online](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkId=267542) or [Exchange Online Protection](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkId=285351). 
  
## Use Exchange Online PowerShell to create an address list by using recipient filters

This example creates an address list for all users with Exchange mailboxes who reside in Washington or Oregon.
  
```
New-AddressList -Name "Pacific Northwest Mailboxes" -RecipientFilter {((RecipientType -eq 'UserMailbox') -and ((StateOrProvince -eq 'Washington') -or (StateOrProvince -eq 'Oregon')))}
```

This example creates an address list for all users with Exchange mailboxes who have `AgencyB` as the value for the _CustomAttribute15_ parameter. 
  
```
New-AddressList -Name "AgencyB" -RecipientFilter {(RecipientType -eq 'UserMailbox') -and (CustomAttribute15 -like *AgencyB*)}
```

For detailed syntax and parameter information, see [New-AddressList](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/2bcee6db-01d4-40ad-9595-33356a4025c5.aspx).
