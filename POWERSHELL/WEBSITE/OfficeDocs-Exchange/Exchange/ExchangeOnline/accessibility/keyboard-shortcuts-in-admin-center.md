## Get started
<a name="BKMK_getstarted"> </a>

Navigate with Internet Explorer and keyboard shortcuts, and make sure that you have the appropriate Office 365 subscription and admin role to work in the EAC. Then, open the EAC and get started.
  
### Use your browser and keyboard to navigate in the EAC

Exchange Online, which includes the EAC, is a web-based application, so the keyboard shortcuts and navigation may be different from those in Exchange 2016. [Accessibility in the Exchange admin center](accessibility-in-exchange-admin-center.md).
  
For best results when working in the EAC in Exchange Online, use Internet Explorer as your browser. [Learn more about Internet Explorer keyboard shortcuts](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=787614).
  
Many tasks in the EAC require the use of pop-up windows so, in your browser, be sure to [enable pop-up windows for Office 365](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=317550).
  
### Confirm your Office 365 subscription plan

Exchange Online is included in Office 365 business and enterprise subscription plans, but capabilities may differ by plan. If your EAC doesn't include a function described in this article, your plan might not include it.
  
For more information about the Exchange Online capabilities in your subscription plan, go to [What Office 36 business product or license do I have?](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=797552) and [Exchange Online Service Description](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=797553).

 **Notes**
  
- The shortcuts in this topic refer to the US keyboard layout. Keys for other layouts might not correspond exactly to the keys on a US keyboard.
    
- If a shortcut requires pressing two or more keys at the same time, this topic separates the keys with a plus sign (+). If you have to press one key immediately after another, the keys are separated by a comma (,).
    
- The EAC runs in your web browser, so it does not use accelerator keys or KeyTips. For example, pressing Alt moves the focus to the browser menu bar, and familiar shortcuts, like Ctrl+P (Print) and F1 (Help), run browser commands rather than EAC commands.
    
To cycle through EAC regions on the screen, press Ctrl+F6 (forward) or Ctrl+Shift+F6 (backward). The Ctrl+F6 navigation cycle order is:
  
- Left feature pane, or primary navigation links
    
- Menu bar, or secondary navigation links
    
- Toolbar
    
- Main window list view
    
- Details view in the right pane
    
- Office 365 app launcher
