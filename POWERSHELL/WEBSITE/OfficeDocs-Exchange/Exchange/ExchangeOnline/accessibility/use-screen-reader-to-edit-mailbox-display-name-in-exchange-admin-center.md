## Get started
<a name="BKMK_GetStarted"> </a>

Navigate with Internet Explorer and keyboard shortcuts, and make sure that you have the appropriate Office 365 subscription and admin role to perform this task. Then, open the EAC and get started.
  
### Use your browser and keyboard to navigate in the EAC

Exchange Online, which includes the EAC, is a web-based application, so the keyboard shortcuts and navigation may be different from those in Exchange 2016. 
  
For best results, when working in the EAC in Exchange Online, use Internet Explorer as your browser. [Learn more about Internet Explorer keyboard shortcuts](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=786972).
  
Many tasks in the EAC require the use of pop-up windows so, in your browser, be sure to [enable pop-up windows](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=798796) for Office 365.
  
### Confirm your Office 365 subscription plan

Exchange Online is included in Office 365 business and enterprise subscription plans; however, capabilities may differ by plan. If your EAC doesn't include a function described in this article, your plan might not include it. 
  
For more information on the Exchange Online capabilities in your subscription plan, go to [What Office 365 business product or license do I have?](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=797552) and [Exchange Online Service Description](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=797553).

1. Once you are in the EAC, to navigate to the page body, press Ctrl+F6. You hear "Welcome."
    
2. Press the Tab key until you hear "Mailboxes." This is the first link after "Recipients."
    
3. To select the link and go to the **Mailboxes** page, press Enter. This takes you to the **Mailboxes** tab on the **Mailboxes** page. The focus is on the **Mailboxes** tab. 
    
4. To get to the **Mailbox** pane, press Ctrl+F6 twice. You hear the first name in the list of mailboxes. 
    
5. Use the arrow keys to select the mailbox you want to update. You hear each mailbox user's name as that listing is selected.
    
6. When you have found the mailbox you want to edit, press Enter. This opens a pop-up window. You hear the URL of that pop-up window. The focus is on the **General** tab within the **Edit Mailbox** page. 
    
7. To get to the **Display Name** field on the **General** tab, press the Tab key. You hear "Display name." 
    
8. Type in the new display name.
    
9. To get to the **Save** button, press the Tab key (you hear "Save button"), and press Enter. This returns you to the **Mailbox List** tab. The focus will be on the name you just edited. 
    
    > [!TIP]
    > It may take a few minutes to save the new mailbox and close the pop-up window. There is no additional feedback to provide during this wait time.
