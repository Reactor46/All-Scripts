# Use a screen reader to identify your admin role in the Exchange admin center

To complete administrative tasks in the Exchange admin center (EAC) in Exchange Online, you need the appropriate administrative permissions, which are grouped and assigned by role. By using a screen reader and keyboard shortcuts, you can identify your admin role, in addition to the role you must be assigned to complete particular tasks.
  
> [!NOTE]
> To learn how to open the EAC, refer to [Use a screen reader to open the Exchange admin center](use-screen-reader-to-open-exchange-admin-center.md). To learn more admin role groups, go to [Understanding management role groups](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=798789). 
  
1. In the EAC, to move the focus to **Dashboard**, which is the first link in the navigation pane, press Ctrl+F6 twice. You hear "Dashboard, Primary navigation link." 
    
2. In the navigation pane, to move the focus to the **Permissions** link, press the Tab key until you hear "Permissions, Primary navigation link." Press Enter. 
    
3. To move the focus to the admin roles link on the content area of the page, press Crtl+F6. You hear "Admin roles, Secondary navigation link."
    
4. To move the focus to each of the following three elements of the user interface, press the Tab key for each element:
    
1. The main content for admin roles. You hear "Role groups."
    
2. The **Name** column. You hear "Name, Column header." 
    
3. The list of admin role groups in the **Name** column. You hear the name of the first role group, which is **Compliance Management**, followed by "Row." 
    
5. In the list of admin role groups, to move between and select the name of a group, use the Up Arrow and Down Arrow keys. As you select each group, you hear its name, followed by "Row."
    
6. Select the admin role group that includes the role you need to complete a task. 
    
    > [!TIP]
    > If you don't know the role required for a particular task, select the admin role group that you think might include roles related to your task, perform step 6, and pay particular attention to the assigned roles. 
  
7. To move the focus to the details pane for the admin role group, press Ctrl+F6: 
    
  - If you're using Narrator, you hear all the details for the admin role group, including a description of the group, assigned roles, members, managed by, and write scope.
    
  - If you're using JAWS, to hear the description of the admin role group, press the Down Arrow key, and then, to hear the rest of the text in the details pane, press Alt+Down Arrow.
    
8. If you do not hear your name among the members, you have not been assigned the appropriate role to complete your task. Contact your Office 365 administrator.
