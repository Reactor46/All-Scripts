1. After you are on the EAC Dashboard (home) page, to navigate to the page body, press Ctrl+F6. You hear "Welcome."
    
2. Press the Tab key until you hear "Resources," which is the second link after "Recipients."
    
3. To go to the **Resources** tab on the **Mailboxes** page, press Enter. The focus is on the **Resources** tab. 
    
4. To get to the **New** button in the **Resources** pane, press Ctrl+F6. You hear "New button." 
    
5. To open the **New Item** submenu, press Spacebar. 
    
6. To go to the **Equipment Mailbox** option, press the Down Arrow key. You hear "Equipment mailbox." (Narrator says, "Blank line.") 
    
7. To open a **New Equipment Mailbox** form in a pop-up window, press Enter. You hear the URL of the pop-up window and, eventually, "Equipment name." The focus is in the **Equipment Name** box. 
    
  -     > [!TIP]
    > There are only three boxes on this form: **Equipment Name**, **Email Address**, and **Domain**. All three are required. 
  
8. Type in the name of the device and, to move to the **Email Address** box, press the Tab key. You hear "Email address." 
    
  -     > [!TIP]
    > This name will appear in users' Outlook Address Book. To make rooms easier for users to find, use a consistent naming convention within your organization. 
  
9. The email address is also required. Type in the first portion of the email address (before the at sign) and, to get to the domain drop-down list, press the Tab key. You hear the selected domain option.
    
10. If the default selection in the domain drop-down menu is not the domain you want to choose, to access other available domains, press the Down Arrow key. As you move through the available options, you hear the domain name and suffix. When you find the domain you want to use, to select it, press Enter.
    
  -     > [!TIP]
    > You cannot type any values into the domain box. It is a prepopulated drop-down list. To add domains to that drop-down list, contact your Office admin. 
  
11. To go to the **Save** button, press the Tab key. You hear "Save." 
    
12. Press Enter. This saves the mailbox you created with the values you assigned, and the pop-up window closes, returning you to the **Resources** list on the **Resources** tab. The focus is on the **New Mailbox** button. You hear "New mailbox." 
    
  -     > [!TIP]
    > It may take a few minutes to save the new mailbox and close the pop-up window. You do not hear any additional feedback during this wait time.
