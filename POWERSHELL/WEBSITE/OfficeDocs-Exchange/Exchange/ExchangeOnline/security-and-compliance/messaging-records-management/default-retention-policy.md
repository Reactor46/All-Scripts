# Default Retention Policy in Exchange Online and Exchange Server

Exchange creates the retention policy Default MRM Policy in your Exchange Online and on-premises Exchange organization. The policy is automatically applied to new users in Exchange Online. In on-premises organizations, the policy is applied when you create an archive for the mailbox. You can change the retention policy applied to a user at any time. 
  
You can modify tags included in the Default MRM Policy, for example by changing the retention age or retention actions, disable a tag, or modify the policy by adding or removing tags from it. The updated policy is applied to mailboxes the next time they're processed by the Managed Folder Assistant

## More information

- A Retention Tag can be linked to more than one Retention Policy. For details about managing [Retention tags and retention policies](retention-tags-and-policies.md), see [Messaging Records Management Procedures](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/bc2ff408-4a2b-4202-9515-e3e922a6320d.aspx).
    
- The Default MRM Policy doesn't include a DPT to automatically delete items (but it does contain personal tags with the delete retention action that users can apply to mailbox items). If you want to automatically delete items after a specified period, you can create a DPT with the required delete action and add it to the policy. For details, see [Create a Retention Policy](create-a-retention-policy.md) and [Add retention tags to or remove retention tags from a retention policy](add-or-remove-retention-tags.md).
    
- Retention policies are applied to mailbox users. The same policy applies to the user's mailbox and archive.
