## Use the EAC to remove a public folder

1. Navigate to **Public folders** \> **Public folders**.
    
2. In the list view, select the public folder you want to delete. Note that clicking on the folder name will display sub-folders within that folder, if there are any. At that point you can click to select a specific sub-folder to remove.
    
     To delete a folder or sub-folder, click anywhere on the folder's row except the underlined name of the folder, and then click **Delete** ![Delete icon](../../media/ITPro_EAC_DeleteIcon.gif). If you click the underlined name of the folder, the **Delete** option will not be available to select.

3. A warning box displays asking if you're sure you want to delete the public folder. Click **Yes** to continue. 
    
## Use Exchange Online PowerShell to delete a public folder

This example deletes the public folder Help Desk\Resolved. This command assumes that the Resolved public folder doesn't have any subfolders. 
  
```
Remove-PublicFolder -Identity "\Help Desk\Resolved"
```

This example tests the previous command without making any modifications.
  
```
Remove-PublicFolder -Identity "\HelpDesk\Resolved" -WhatIf
```

This example removes the public folder Marketing and all its subfolders because the command runs recursively.
  
```
Remove-PublicFolder -Identity "\Marketing" -Recurse:$True
```
