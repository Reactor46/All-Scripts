# OWA for Devices contact sync

Office 365 users can synchronize their Outlook Web App contacts with the address book on their iPhone or iPad using the OWA for Devices contact sync feature. It's already turned on for Outlook Web App users. And as the Office 365 admin, you can turn it off if you have issues with allowing the user's contacts to be sync'd for their iPhone or iPad. This setting is applied to all mailboxes.
  
## How can you change it?

On the Office 365 portal, go to **Admin** \> **Service settings** \> **Mobile access**.
  
- Turn on **OWA for Devices contact sync** so users can sync their Outlook Web App contacts with the address book on their iPhone or iPad.

## What is OWA for Devices contact sync?

OWA for Devices refers to the OWA for iPhone and OWA for iPad apps. With these two apps, users can set up their iPhone or iPad to synchronize their Outlook Web App contacts with their mobile device's address book on their device. 
  
Office 365 admins can use OWA for Devices contact sync to control whether users can sync their contacts from Outlook Web App. This feature is already turned on when a user's mailbox is created allowing users to easily maintain their business contacts on several iOS devices. However, if you have privacy or security concerns and don't want the contact information for your organization shared to your users' iOS devices or any services they use for storing data, you can turn OWA for Devices contact sync off.
  
When you turn OWA for Devices contact sync off, the contents of a user's Outlook Web App contacts folder won't be copied to their iOS device address book. Any contact information that was previously synchronized with the user's iOS devices is removed. However, the user can change their iOS device's privacy setting to not allow access to Outlook Web Access. In this case, the data cannot be altered or removed. After you turn OWA for Devices contact sync off, it can take up to eight hours for the change to take effect. 
  
OWA for Devices contact sync controls synchronization only for users who connect to their mailboxes by using the OWA for iPhone or OWA for iPad apps. If you have enabled Exchange ActiveSync in your organization and users have set up an ActiveSync account, users can still sync their contacts to their mobile device. Exchange ActiveSync is offered on many mobile devices and can provide different levels of security for your organization's data.
