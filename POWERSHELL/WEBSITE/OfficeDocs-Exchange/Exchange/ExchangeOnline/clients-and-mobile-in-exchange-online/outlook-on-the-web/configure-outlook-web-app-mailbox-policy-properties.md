# View or configure Outlook Web App mailbox policy properties

After you create an Outlook Web App mailbox policy, you can configure a variety of options to control the features available to users in Outlook Web App. For example, you can enable or disable Inbox rules or create a list of allowed file types for attachments.
  
## What do you need to know before you begin?

- Estimated time to complete each procedure: 3 minutes.
    
- You need to be assigned permissions before you can perform this procedure or procedures. To see what permissions you need, see the "Outlook Web App mailbox policies" entry in the [Client Access Permissions](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/57eca42a-5a7f-4c65-89f0-7a84f2dbea19.aspx) topic. 
    
- For information about keyboard shortcuts that may apply to the procedures in this topic, see [Keyboard shortcuts for the Exchange admin center](../../accessibility/keyboard-shortcuts-in-admin-center.md).
    
> [!TIP]
> Having problems? Ask for help in the Exchange forums. Visit the forums at [Exchange Online](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkId=267542) or [Exchange Online Protection](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkId=285351).. 
  
## Use the EAC to view or configure Outlook Web App mailbox policies

1. In the EAC, click **Permissions** \> **Outlook Web App policies**.
    
2. In the result pane, click to select the mailbox policy you want to view or configure.
    
3. Click the **Edit** button. 
    
4. On the **General** tab, you can view and edit the name of the policy. 
    
5. On the **Features** tab, use the check boxes to enable or disable features. By default, the most common features are displayed. To see all features that can be enabled or disabled, click **More options**.
    
    > [!NOTE]
    > Features settings for Outlook Web App mailbox policies override Outlook Web App virtual directory settings. You can change segmentation settings for individual users by using the **Set-CASMailbox** cmdlet in Exchange Online PowerShell. 
  
6. On the **File Access** tab, use the **Direct file access** check boxes to configure the file access and viewing options for users. File access lets a user open or view the contents of files attached to an email message. 
    
    File access can be controlled based on whether a user has signed in on a public or private computer. The option for users to select private computer access or public computer access is available only when you're using forms-based authentication. All other forms of authentication default to private computer access.
    
7. On the **Offline access** tab, use the option buttons to configure offline access availability. 
    
8. Click **Save** to update the policy.
