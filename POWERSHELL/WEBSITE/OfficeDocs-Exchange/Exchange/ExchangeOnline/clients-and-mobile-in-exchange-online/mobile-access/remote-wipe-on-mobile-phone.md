## Use the EAC to wipe a user's phone

You can use the EAC to wipe a user's phone or cancel a remote wipe that has not yet completed. 
  
1. In the EAC, navigate to **Recipients** \> **Mailboxes**.
    
2. Select the user, and under **Mobile Devices**, choose **View details**.
    
3. On the **Mobile Device Details** page, select the lost mobile device, and then select **Wipe Data**.
    
4. Select **Save**.
    
## Use Exchange Online PowerShell to wipe a user's phone

You can use the **Clear-MobileDevice** cmdlet in Exchange Online PowerShell to wipe a user's phone. 
  
The following command wipes the device named WM_TonySmith and sends a confirmation message to admin@contoso.com.
  
```
Clear-MobileDevice -Identity WM_TonySmith -NotificationEmailAddresses "admin@contoso.com"
```

## Use Outlook Web App to wipe a user's phone

Your users can wipe their own phone using Outlook Web App.

## How do you know this worked?

There are several ways to verify that the remote wipe completed.
  
- Run the **Clear-MobileDevice** cmdlet with the _-NotificationEmailAddresses_ parameter configured. A message will be sent to the supplied email address when the remote wipe has completed.
