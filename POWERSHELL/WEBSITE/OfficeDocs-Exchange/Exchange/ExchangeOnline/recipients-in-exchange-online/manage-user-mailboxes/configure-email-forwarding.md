# Configure email forwarding for a mailbox

Email forwarding lets you to set up a mailbox to forward email messages sent to that mailbox to another user's mailbox in or outside of your organization.
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you're using Office 365 for business, you should configure email forwarding in the [Office 365 admin center: Configure email forwarding in Office 365 ](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=834774)
  
If your organization uses an on-premises Exchange or hybrid Exchange environment, you should use the on-premises Exchange admin center (EAC) to create and manage shared mailboxes.
  
## Use the Exchange admin center to configure email forwarding

You can use the Exchange admin center (EAC) set up email forwarding to a single internal recipient, a single external recipient (using a mail contact), or multiple recipients (using a distribution group).
  
You need to be assigned permissions before you can perform this procedure or procedures. To see what permissions you need, see the "Recipient Provisioning Permissions" entry in the [Recipients Permissions](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/5b690bcb-c6df-4511-90e1-08ca91f43b37.aspx) topic. 
  
1. In the EAC, navigate to **Recipients** \> **Mailboxes**.
    
2. In the list of user mailboxes, click or tap the mailbox that you want to configure mail forwarding for, and then click or tap **Edit** ![Edit icon](../../media/ITPro_EAC_EditIcon.gif).
    
3. On the mailbox properties page, click **Mailbox Features**.
    
4. Under **Mail Flow**, select **View details** to view or change the setting for forwarding email messages. 
    
    On this page, you can set the maximum number of recipients that the user can send a message to. For on-premises Exchange organizations, the recipient limit is unlimited. For Exchange Online organizations, the limit is 500 recipients.
    
5. Check the **Enable forwarding** check box, and then click or tap **Browse**.
    
6. On the **Select Recipient** page, select a user you want to forward all email to. Select the **Deliver message to both forwarding address and mailbox** check box if you want both the recipient and the forwarding email address to get copies of the emails sent. Click or tap **OK**, and then click or tap **Save**.
    
What if you want to forward mail to an address outside your organization? Or forward mail to multiple recipients? You can do that, too!
  
- **External addresses**: Create a mail contact and then, in the steps above, select the mail contact on the **Select Recipient** page. Need to know how to create a mail contact? Check out [Manage mail contacts](../../recipients-in-exchange-online/manage-mail-contacts.md).
    
- **Multiple recipients**: Create a distribution group, add recipients to it, and then in the steps above, select the mail contact on the **Select Recipient** page. Need to know how to create a mail contact? Check out [Create and manage distribution groups](../../recipients-in-exchange-online/manage-distribution-groups/manage-distribution-groups.md).
    
## How do you know this worked?

To make sure that you've successfully configured email forwarding, do one of the following:
  
1. In the EAC, go to **Recipients** \> **Mailboxes**.
    
2. In the list of user mailboxes, click or tap the mailbox that you configured email forwarding for, and then click **Edit** ![Edit icon](../../media/ITPro_EAC_EditIcon.gif).
    
3. On the mailbox properties page, click or tap **Mailbox Features**.
    
4. Under **Mail Flow**, click or tap **View details** to view the mail forwarding settings.
