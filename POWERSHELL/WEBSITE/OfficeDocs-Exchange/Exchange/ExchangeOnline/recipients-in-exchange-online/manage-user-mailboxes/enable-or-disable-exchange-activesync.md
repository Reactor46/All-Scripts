## Use Exchange Online PowerShell to enable or disable Exchange ActiveSync

This example disables Exchange ActiveSync for the mailbox of Yan Li.
  
```
Set-CASMailbox -Identity "Yan Li" -ActiveSyncEnabled $false
```

```
Set-CASMailbox -Identity Ellyn@contoso.com -ActiveSyncEnabled $true
```

## How do you know this worked?

To verify that you've successfully enabled or disabled Exchange ActiveSync for a user mailbox, do one of the following:
  
- In the EAC, navigate to **Recipients** \> **Mailboxes**, click the mailbox, and then click **Edit** ![Edit icon](../../media/ITPro_EAC_EditIcon.gif).
    
- On the mailbox properties page, click **Mailbox Features**.
    
- Under **Mobile Devices**, verify whether Exchange ActiveSync is enabled or disabled.
    
Or
  
- Run the following command in Exchange Online PowerShell.
    
  ```
  Get-CASMailbox <identity>
  ```

    If Exchange ActiveSync is enabled, the value for the _ActiveSyncEnabled_ property is `True`. If Exchange ActiveSync is disabled, the value is `False`.
