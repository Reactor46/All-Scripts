# Enable or disable MAPI for a mailbox

You can use the Exchange admin center or Exchange Online PowerShell to enable or disable MAPI for a user mailbox. When MAPI is enabled, a user's mailbox can be accessed by Outlook or other MAPI email clients. When MAPI is disabled, it can't be accessed by Outlook or other MAPI clients. However, the mailbox will continue to receive email messages, and, assuming that the mailbox is enabled to support access by those clients, a user can access the mailbox to send and receive email by using Outlook Web App, a POP email client, or an IMAP client.
  
> [!NOTE]
> Support for Outlook Web App and MAPI, POP3, and IMAP4 email clients is enabled by default when a user mailbox is created. 
  
For additional management tasks related to managing email client access to a mailbox, see the following topics:

## Use the EAC to enable or disable MAPI

1. In the EAC, navigate to **Recipients** \> **Mailboxes**.
    
2. In the list of user mailboxes, click the mailbox that you want to enable or disable MAPI, and then click **Edit** ![Edit icon](../../media/ITPro_EAC_EditIcon.gif).
    
3. On the mailbox properties page, click **Mailbox Features**.
    
4. Under **Email Connectivity**, do one of the following.
    
  - To disable MAPI, under **MAPI: Enabled**, click **Disable**.
    
    A warning appears asking if you're sure you want to disable MAPI. Click **Yes**.
    
  - To enable MAPI, under **MAPI: Disabled**, click **Enable**.
    
5.  Click **Save** to save your change. 
    
## Use Exchange Online PowerShell to enable or disable MAPI

This example disables MAPI for the mailbox of Ken Sanchez.
  
```
Set-CASMailbox -Identity "Ken Sanchez" -MAPIEnabled $false
```

This example enables MAPI for the mailbox of Esther Valle.
  
```
Set-CASMailbox -Identity "Esther Valle" -MAPIEnabled $true
```

For detailed syntax and parameter information, see [Set-CASMailbox](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/ff7d4dc5-755e-4005-a0a3-631eed3f9b3b.aspx).
  
## How do you know this worked?

To verify that you've successfully enabled or disabled MAPI for a user mailbox, do one of the following:
  
- In the EAC, navigate to **Recipients** \> **Mailboxes**, click the mailbox, and then click **Edit** ![Edit icon](../../media/ITPro_EAC_EditIcon.gif).
    
- On the mailbox properties page, click **Mailbox Features**.
    
- Under **Email Connectivity**, verify whether MAPI is enabled or disabled.
    
Or
  
- Run the following command in Exchange Online PowerShell.
    
  ```
  Get-CASMailbox <identity>
  ```

    If MAPI is enabled, the value for the _MapiEnabled_ property is `True`. If MAPI is disabled, the value is `False`.
