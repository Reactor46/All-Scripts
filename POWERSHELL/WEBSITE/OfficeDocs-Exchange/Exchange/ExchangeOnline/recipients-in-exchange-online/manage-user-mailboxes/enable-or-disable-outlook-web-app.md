# Enable or disable Outlook Web App for a mailbox

You can use the EAC or Exchange Online PowerShell to enable or disable Outlook Web App for a user mailbox. When Outlook Web App is enabled, a user can use Outlook Web App to send and receive email. When Outlook Web App is disabled, the mailbox will continue to receive email messages, and a user can access it to send and receive email by using a MAPI client, such as Microsoft Outlook, or with a POP or IMAP email client, assuming that the mailbox is enabled to support access by those clients.
  
> [!NOTE]
> Support for Outlook Web App and MAPI, POP3, and IMAP4 email clients is enabled by default when a user mailbox is created. 
  
For additional management tasks related to managing email client access to a mailbox, see the following topics:

4. Under **Email Connectivity**, do one of the following:
    
  - To disable Outlook Web App, under **Outlook Web App: Enabled**, click **Disable**.
    
    A warning appears asking if you're sure you want to disable Outlook Web App. Click **Yes**.

## Use Exchange Online PowerShell to enable or disable Outlook Web App

This example disables Outlook Web App for the mailbox of Yan Li.
  
```
Set-CASMailbox -Identity "Yan Li" -OWAEnabled $false
```

```
Set-CASMailbox -Identity Ellyn@contoso.com -OWAEnabled $true
```

## How do you know this worked?

To verify that you've successfully enabled or disabled Outlook Web App for a user mailbox, do one of the following:
  
- In the EAC, navigate to **Recipients** \> **Mailboxes**, click the mailbox, and then click **Edit** ![Edit icon](../../media/ITPro_EAC_EditIcon.gif).
    
- On the mailbox properties page, click **Mailbox Features**.
    
- Under **Email Connectivity**, verify whether Outlook Web App is enabled or disabled.
    
Or
  
- Run the following command in Exchange Online PowerShell.
