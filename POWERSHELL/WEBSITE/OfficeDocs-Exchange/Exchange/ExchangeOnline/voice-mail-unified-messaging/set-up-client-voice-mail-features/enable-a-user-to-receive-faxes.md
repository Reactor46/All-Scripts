# Enable a user to receive faxes

You can enable a Unified Messaging (UM) user to receive faxes. By default, when you enable a user for Unified Messaging, they will be able to receive faxes if you enable faxing and configure a fax partner's URI on the UM mailbox policy that is linked to the user. Faxing can be enabled or disabled on UM dial plans, UM mailbox policies, or the UM-enabled user's mailbox. 
  
By default, the user's mailbox and the dial plan that is linked with the user allow incoming faxes. However, for a user to receive faxes you must first enable inbound faxing on the UM mailbox policy that's associated with the UM-enabled user and enter the fax partner's URI.
  
> [!NOTE]
> You can use the EAC to configure fax settings on a UM mailbox policy. However, you must use Exchange Online PowerShell to configure fax settings on dial plans or for individual users. 
  
For more information about fax partners, see [Microsoft PinPoint for Fax Partners](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=190238).
  
 For additional management tasks related to faxing, see [Faxing procedures](faxing-procedures.md).
