# Set mailbox features for an Outlook Voice Access user

Telephone user interface (TUI) settings are used when a user accesses the Unified Messaging (UM) system by using Outlook Voice Access. When you modify a UM-enabled user's TUI configuration settings, you modify properties and their values on the UM-enabled user's mailbox.
  
You can change the following TUI settings for a UM-enabled user:
  
- Allow subscriber access 
    
- Allow TUI access to the calendar
    
- Allow TUI access to email
    
- Allow Automatic Speech Recognition 
    
For additional management tasks related to UM users, see [Set mailbox features for an Outlook Voice Access user](set-mailbox-features-for-a-user.md).

## Use Exchange Online PowerShell to modify a single UM-enabled user's TUI settings

This example enables calendar and email access using the TUI for a UM-enabled user named Tony Smith.
  
```
Set-UMMailbox -Identity tony@contoso.com TUIAccessToCal True -TUIAccessToEmail True -OperatorNumber 111111 -DisableMissedCallNotification False -AnonCallBlock True
```

> [!NOTE]
> TUI settings for users are also available on UM mailbox policies. Modifying TUI settings on a UM mailbox policy affects all users who are associated with the UM mailbox policy. For more information about how to modify TUI settings on a UM mailbox policy, see [Set mailbox features for Outlook Voice Access users](set-mailbox-features-for-users.md).
