# Authorize calls for users in a dial plan

You can enable dialing authorizations on a Unified Messaging (UM) dial plan. Dialing authorizations on a dial plan are used to prohibit unauthenticated Outlook Voice Access users from making in-country/region or international telephone calls, or outdialing. Outdialing happens when Unified Messaging places an outgoing call for a user after they've called in to an Outlook Voice Access phone number that is configured on a UM dial plan. When you configure a setting on a UM dial plan, that setting applies to all unauthenticated users that call in to an Outlook Voice Access number.
  
For additional management tasks related to outdialing, see [Allowing users to make calls procedures](allow-users-to-make-calls-procedures.md).
