# Authorize calls for a group of users

You can enable dialing authorizations on a Unified Messaging (UM) mailbox policy. You can use dialing authorizations on a mailbox policy to prohibit authenticated Outlook Voice Access users that are linked to the UM mailbox policy from making in-country/region or international telephone calls, or outdialing. Outdialing happens when Unified Messaging places an outgoing call for a user after they've called in to an Outlook Voice Access phone number that is configured on a UM dial plan. When you configure a setting on a UM mailbox policy, that setting applies to all UM-enabled users linked with the UM mailbox policy.
  
For additional management tasks related to outdialing, see [Allowing users to make calls procedures](allow-users-to-make-calls-procedures.md).

## Use Exchange Online PowerShell to enable in-country/region and international dialing authorizations on a UM mailbox policy

This example enables the InCountry/RegionGroup1, InCountry/RegionGroup2, InternationalGroup1, and InternationalGroup2 dialing authorizations on a UM mailbox policy named `MyUMMailboxPolicy`.
  
```
Set-UMMailboxPolicy -Identity MyUMMailboxPolicy -AllowedInCountryOrRegionGroups InCountry/RegionGroup1,InCountry/RegionGroup2 -AllowedInternationalGroups InternationalGroup1,InternationalGroup2
```
