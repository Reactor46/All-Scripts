# Disable missed call notifications for a user

You can enable or disable missed call notifications for a Unified Messaging (UM) mailbox policy by using Exchange Online PowerShell or the EAC. A missed call notification is an email message that's sent to a user when the user doesn't answer an incoming call and the caller doesn't leave a voice message. This is a different email message than the one that contains the voice message that's left for a user.
  
When you disable missed call notifications on a UM mailbox policy, you prevent all users associated with the UM mailbox policy from receiving an email message when they don't answer an incoming call and the caller doesn't leave a voice message. By default, missed call notifications are enabled for each UM mailbox policy that's created. Also by default, a UM mailbox policy is created every time you create a UM dial plan.
  
> [!NOTE]
> When you're integrating Unified Messaging and Microsoft Lync Server, missed call notifications aren't available to users that have a mailbox located on an Exchange 2007 or Exchange 2010 Mailbox server when a user disconnects before the call is sent to a Mailbox server running the Microsoft Exchange Unified Messaging service. 
  
For additional management tasks related to UM mailbox policies, see [Manage a UM mailbox policy](../../voice-mail-unified-messaging/set-up-voice-mail/manage-um-mailbox-policy.md).
