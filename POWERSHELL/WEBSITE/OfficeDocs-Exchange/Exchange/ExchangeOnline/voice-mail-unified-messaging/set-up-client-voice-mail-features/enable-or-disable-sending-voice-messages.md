# Enable or disable sending voice messages from Outlook Voice Access

You can enable Outlook Voice Access users to send voice mail messages to other UM-enabled users who are associated with the same dial plan, or prevent them from doing so. 
  
By default, this setting is enabled. If you disable this setting, Outlook Voice Access users that call into an Outlook Voice Access number won't be able to send voice messages to users within the same dial plan.
  
For additional tasks related to UM dial plans, see [UM Dial Plan Procedures](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/1bda77c8-c4e2-4ae0-a001-76ae029bf843.aspx).

## Use the EAC to enable or prevent Outlook Voice Access users sending voice messages to users in the same dial plan

1. In the EAC, navigate to **Unified Messaging** \> **UM dial plans**.
    
2. In the list view, select the UM dial plan you want to change, and then click **Edit** ![Edit icon](../../media/ITPro_EAC_EditIcon.gif).
    
3. On the **UM dial plan** page, click **Configure**.
    
4. In **Transfer & search**, under **Allow callers to**, select **Leave voice messages without ringing a user's phone** to allow sending voice messages. If you want to prevent sending voice messages for users, clear this setting. 
    
5. Click **Save**.
    
## Use Exchange Online PowerShell to enable or prevent Outlook Voice Access users sending voice messages to users in the same dial plan

This example enables Outlook Voice Access users associated with the UM dial plan named `MyUMDialPlan` to send voice messages to users associated with the same dial plan. 
  
```
Set-UMDialPlan -identity MyUMDialPlan -SendVoiceMsgEnabled $true
```

This example prevents Outlook Voice Access users associated with the UM dial plan named `MyUMDialPlan` from sending voice messages to users associated with the same dial plan. 
  
```
Set-UMDialPlan -identity MyUMDialPlan -SendVoiceMsgEnabled $false
```
