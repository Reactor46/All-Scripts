# Enable or disable directory lookups

You can enable directory lookups so that callers who call in to a Unified Messaging (UM) auto attendant can look up names in the directory using their telephone keypad but not be able to search the directory using voice inputs. This setting is enabled by default. If this setting is disabled, callers won't be able to search the directory for a specific person using touchtone or voice commands.
  
For additional management tasks related to UM auto attendants, see [UM auto attendant procedures](um-auto-attendant-procedures.md).
  
> [!NOTE]
> Outlook Voice Access users can't use Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) or speech inputs to locate users in the directory, they can only use DTMF or touchtone inputs.

2. On the **UM Dial Plan** page, under **UM Auto Attendants**, select the UM auto attendant for which you want to enable or disable directory lookups, and then click **Edit** ![Edit icon](../../media/ITPro_EAC_EditIcon.gif).
    
3. On the **UM Auto Attendant** page \> **Address book and operator access**, under **Options for searching the address book**, select the check box next to **Allow callers to search for users by name or alias** to enable callers to search for users. To disable callers from searching for users, clear this check box.
