# Enable or disable Exchange ActiveSync access to mailboxes in Exchange Server

ActiveSync is a client protocol that lets users synchronize their Exchange mailbox with a mobile device. By default, ActiveSync is enabled on new user mailboxes. Disabling ActiveSync on a mailbox prevents the user from synchronizing their mailbox with a mobile device (by using ActiveSync).
  
Administrators can use the Exchange admin center (EAC) or the Exchange Management Shell to enable or disable Exchange ActiveSync access to a mailbox.
  
For more information about ActiveSync, see [Exchange ActiveSync](exchange-activesync.md).

## Enable or disable Exchange ActiveSync access to a single mailbox

### Use the EAC to enable or disable Exchange ActiveSync access to a mailbox

1. In the EAC, go to **Recipients** \> **Mailboxes**.
    
2. In the list of mailboxes, find the mailbox that you want to modify. You can:
    
  - Scroll through the list of mailboxes.
    
  - Click **Search** ![Search icon](../../media/ITPro_EAC_.png) and enter part of the user's name, email address, or alias.
    
  - Click **More options** ![More Options icon](../../media/ITPro_EAC_MoreOptionsIcon.png) \> **Advanced search** to find the mailbox.
    
    Once you've found the mailbox that you want to modify, select it, and then click **Edit** ![Edit icon](../../media/ITPro_EAC_EditIcon.png).
    
3. On the mailbox properties page that opens, click **Mailbox features**.
    
4. In the **Mobile Devices** section, configure one of these settings: 
    
  - If ActiveSync is enabled on the mailbox, you'll see a **Disable Exchange ActiveSync** link. Click the link to disable ActiveSync, and then click **Yes** in the warning message that appears.
    
  - If ActiveSync is disabled on the mailbox, you'll see a **Enable Exchange ActiveSync** link. Click the link to enable ActiveSync.
    
    ![Mobile device settings for a mailbox in the EAC at Recipients \> select mailbox \> Edit \> Mailbox features \> Mobile Devices](../../media/52364427-9557-443e-8366-35a1339a0f15.png)
  
    When you're finished, click **Save**.
    
### Use the Exchange Management Shell to enable or disable Exchange ActiveSync access to a mailbox

To enable or disable ActiveSync access to a single mailbox, use this syntax:
  
```
Set-CasMailbox -Identity <MailboxIdentity> -ActiveSyncEnabled <$true | $false>
```

This example disables ActiveSync access to the mailbox named Yan Li.
  
```
Set-CasMailbox -Identity "Yan Li" -ActiveSyncEnabled $false
```

This example enables ActiveSync access to the mailbox named Elly Nkya.
  
```
Set-CasMailbox -Identity "Elly Nkya" -ActiveSyncEnabled $true
```

For detailed syntax and parameter information, see [Set-CASMailbox](http://technet.microsoft.com/library/ff7d4dc5-755e-4005-a0a3-631eed3f9b3b.aspx).
  
## Enable or disable Exchange ActiveSync access to multiple mailboxes

### Use the EAC to enable or disable Exchange ActiveSync access to multiple mailboxes

1. In the EAC, go to **Recipients** \> **Mailboxes**.
    
2. In the list of mailboxes, find the mailboxes that you want to modify. You can:
    
  - Scroll through the list of mailboxes.
    
  - Click **Search** ![Search icon](../../media/ITPro_EAC_.png) and enter part of the user's name, email address, or alias.
    
  - Click **More options** ![More Options icon](../../media/ITPro_EAC_MoreOptionsIcon.png) \> **Advanced search** to find the mailbox.
    
3. In the list of mailboxes, select multiple mailboxes of the same type (for example, **User**) from the list. For example:
    
  - Select a mailbox, hold down the Shift key, and select another mailbox that's farther down in the list.
    
  - Hold down the CTRL key as you select each mailbox.
    
    After you select multiple mailboxes of the same type, the title of the details pane changes to **Bulk Edit**.
    
4. In the details pane, scroll down to **Exchange ActiveSync**, click **Enable** or **Disable**, and then click **OK** in the warning message that appears.

### Use the Exchange Management Shell to enable or disable Exchange ActiveSync access to multiple mailboxes

You can use the **Get-Mailbox**, **Get-User** or **Get-Content** cmdlets to identify the mailboxes that you want to modify. For example: 
  
- Use the _OrganizationalUnit_ parameter to filter the mailboxes by organizational unit (OU).
    
- Use the _Filter_ parameter to create OPATH filters that identify the mailboxes. For more information, see [Filterable Properties for the -Filter Parameter](http://technet.microsoft.com/library/b02b0005-2fb6-4bc2-8815-305259fa5432.aspx).
    
- Use a text file to specify the mailboxes. The text file contains one mailbox (email address, name, or other unique identifier) on each line like this:
    
  ```
  ebrunner@tailspintoys.com
  fapodaca@tailspintoys.com
  glaureano@tailspintoys.com
  hrim@tailspintoys.com
  ```

This example disables ActiveSync access to all user mailboxes in the North America\Finance OU.
  
```
$NAFinance = Get-Mailbox -OrganizationalUnit "OU=Marketing,OU=North America,DC=contoso,DC=com" -Filter {RecipientTypeDetails -eq 'UserMailbox'} -ResultSize Unlimited; $NAFinance | foreach  {Set-CasMailbox  $_.Identity -ActiveSyncEnabled $false}
```

This example disables ActiveSync access to all user mailboxes in the Engineering department in Washington state.
  
```
Get-User -Filter {RecipientType -eq 'UserMailbox' -and Department -like 'Engineering*' -and StateOrProvince -eq 'WA'} | Set-CasMailbox -ActiveSyncEnabled $false
```

This example uses the text file C:\My Documents\Accounts.txt to disable ActiveSync access to the specified mailboxes.
  
```
Get-Content "C:\My Documents\Accounts.txt" | foreach {Set-CasMailbox $_ -ActiveSyncEnabled $false}
```

For detailed syntax and parameter information, see [Get-Mailbox](http://technet.microsoft.com/library/8a5a6eb9-4a75-47f9-ae3b-a3ba251cf9a8.aspx) and [Get-User](http://technet.microsoft.com/library/2a33c9e6-33da-438c-912d-28ce3f4c9afb.aspx).
  
## How do you know this worked?

To verify that you've successfully enabled or disabled Exchange ActiveSync access to a mailbox, do any of these steps:
  
- In the EAC, go to **Recipients** \> **Mailboxes** \> select the mailbox \> click **Edit** ![Edit icon](../../media/ITPro_EAC_EditIcon.png) \> **Mailbox features** \> and verify the Exchange ActiveSync value in the **Mobile Devices** section.
    
  - If ActiveSync access is enabled for the mailbox, you'll see **Disable Exchange ActiveSync**.
    
  - If ActiveSync access is disabled for the mailbox, you'll see **Enable Exchange ActiveSync**.
    
  ![Mobile device settings for a mailbox in the EAC at Recipients \> select mailbox \> Edit \> Mailbox features \> Mobile Devices](../../media/52364427-9557-443e-8366-35a1339a0f15.png)
  
- In the Exchange Management Shell, replace _\<MailboxIdentity\>_ with the identity of the mailbox (for example, name, alias, or email address), and run this command: 
    
  ```
  Get-CasMailbox -Identity "<MailboxIdentity>"
  ```

- Use the same filter that you used to identify the mailboxes, but use the **Get-CasMailbox** cmdlet instead of **Set-CasMailbox**. For example: 
    
  ```
  Get-User -Filter {RecipientType -eq 'UserMailbox' -and Department -like 'Engineering*' -and StateOrProvince -eq 'WA'} | Get-CasMailbox
  ```

- In the Exchange Management Shell, run this command to show all mailboxes where ActiveSync access is disabled:
    
  ```
  Get-CasMailbox -ResultSize unlimited -Filter {ActiveSyncEnabled -eq $false}
  ```
