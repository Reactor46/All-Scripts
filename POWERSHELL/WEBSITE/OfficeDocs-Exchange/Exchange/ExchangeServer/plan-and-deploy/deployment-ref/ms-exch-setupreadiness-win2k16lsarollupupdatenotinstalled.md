# KB3206632 security update not installed [Win2k16LSARollupUpdateNotInstalled]

Microsoft Exchange Server 2016 Setup can't continue because the local computer requires a software update. You'll need to install this update before Exchange 2016 Setup can continue.
  
Exchange 2016 Setup requires that the December 13, 2016 (KB3206632) security update be installed on the computer before installation can continue.
  
Download and install the 64-bit update from the following URL, and then click **retry** on the **Readiness Checks** page.
  
> [!NOTE]
> If this update requires a reboot to complete installation, you'll need to exit Exchange 2016 Setup, reboot, and then start Setup again.
