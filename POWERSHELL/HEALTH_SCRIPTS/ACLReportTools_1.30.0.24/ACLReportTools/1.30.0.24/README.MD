ACLReportTools
==============
This module contains functions for creating reports on file, folder and share ACL's, storing the reports and comparing them with earlier reports.

Requirements
------------
> PowerShell 2.0

Overview
--------
The intended purpose of this module is to allow an Admininstrator to report on how ACL's for a set of path or shares have changed since a baseline was last created.

Basically it allows administrators to easily see what ACL changes are being made so they keep an eye on any security issues arising.
The process of creating/updating the baseline and producing the ACL Difference report could be easily automated.
If performing SMB share comparisons, the report generation can be performed remotely (from a desktop PC for example).

The process that is normally followed using this module is:

1. Produce a baseline ACL Report from a set of Folders or Shares (even on multiple computers).
2. Export the baseline ACL Report as a file.
3. ... Sometime later ...
4. Import the baseline ACL Report from a stored file.
5. Produce a ACL Difference report comparing the imported baseline ACL Report with the current ACL state of the Folders or Shares.
6. Optionally export the ACL Difference report as HTML.
7. Repeat from step 1.

The above process could be easily automated in many ways (Task Scheduler is suggested).

The comparison is always performed recursively scanning a specified set of folders or SMB shares.
All files and folders within these locations will be scanned, but only non-inherited ACLs will be added to the ACL Reports.

Definitions
-----------
### ACL Report
An **ACL report** is a list of the current ACLs for a set of Shares or Folders.
It is stored as a serialized array of [ACLReportTools.Permission] objects that are returned by the New-ACLShareReport, New-ACLPathFileReport and Import-ACLReport cmdlets.

ACL Reports produced for Shares rather than folders differ in that the Share name is provided in each [ACLReportTools.Permission] object and that the SMB Share ACL is also provided in the [ACLReportTools.Permission] array.

### ACL Difference Report
An **ACL Difference report** is a list of all ACL differences between two ACL reports.
It is stored as serialized array of [ACLReportTools.PermissionDiff] objects that are produced by the Compare-ACLReports cmdlet.


Important Notes
---------------
When performing a comparison, make sure the baseline report used covers the same set of folders/shares you want to compare now.
E.g. Don't try and compare ACLs for c:\windows and c:\wwwroot - that would make no sense.

If shares or folders that are being compared have large numbers of non-inherited ACLs (perhaps because some junior admin doesn't understand inheritance) then a comparison can take a LONG time (hours) and really hog your CPU. If this is the case, run on another machine using Share mode or run after hours - or better yet, teach junior admins about inheritance! :)

This Module uses the awesome NTFS Security Module available here:

https://gallery.technet.microsoft.com/scriptcenter/1abd77a5-9c0b-4a2b-acef-90dbb2b84e85

Ensure that you unblock all files in the NTFSSecurity module before attempting to Import Module ACLReportTools.
Module ACLReportTools automatically looks for and Imports NTFSSecuriy if present.
If it is missing an error will be reported stating that it is missing.
If you recieve any other errors loading ACL Report tools, it is usually because some of the NTFSSecurity module files are blocked and need to be unblocked manually or with Unblock-File.
You can confirm this by calling Import-Module NTFSSecurity - if any errors appear then it is most likely the cause. After unblocking the module files you may need to restart PowerShell.

You should also ensure that the account that is being used to generate the reports has read access to all paths (recursively) you are reporting on and can access also read the ACLs.
If it can't access them then you may get access denied errors.

Installation
------------
* Installation if WMF5.0 is Installed:
1. In PowerShell execute:
```powershell
Install-Module ACLReportTools
```

* Installation if WMF5.0 is Not Installed:
1. Unzip the archive containing the ACLReportTools module into the one of the PowerShell Modules folders.
   E.g. c:\program files\windowspowershell\modules
2. This will create a folder called ACLReportTools containing all the files required for this module.
3. In PowerShell execute:
```powershell
Import-Module ACLReportTools
```

#### SYNOPSIS
Compares two ACL reports and produces an ACL Difference report.

#### DESCRIPTION 
This cmdlets compares two ACL Share reports and produces a difference list in the pipeline that can then be reported on.

A baseline report (usually from importing a previous ACL Share Report) must be provided. The second ACL Share report (called the current ACL Share report) will be compared against the baseline report.
The current ACL report will be either generated by the New-ACLShareReport or New-ACLPathFileReport cmdlets (depending on parameters) or it can be passed in via the With variable.
   
#### PARAMETER Baseline
