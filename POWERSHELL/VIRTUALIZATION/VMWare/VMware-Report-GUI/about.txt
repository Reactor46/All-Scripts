Utility:
vSphere Report GUI

Version:
0.0.2

Introduction:
This GUI is meant to help configure vmware report generation. You are able to select reporting scoped up to the whole farm all the way down to individual hosts.

There are several options for those interested in monitoring their environment. Some options include;

General Options:
- Generating reports only if thresholds are surpassed

Virtual Center
- VC event errors (with threshold in # of days)
- VMs created/cloned/deleted
- VC windows server errors/warnings (with threshold in # of days)
- VC windows server service status

ESX/vSphere Hosts
- Hosts not responding
- Hosts in maintenance
- Host datastore utilization (with % free utilization threshold)

Virtual Machines
- VM snapshots (with threshold in # of days)
- VMs with thin provisioned disks
- VMs with no vmware tools
- VMs with connected CD drives
- VMs with connected floppy drives

Usage:
The GUI is used to perform an initial test connection to the server and to save options. Once connected to the server you can select more granular scoped reports based on the datacenter, cluster, and host if desired. Currently you need to report on the whole farm to get virtual center reporting options.

Once the configuration is saved another script, VMware-Report.ps1 can be used to schedule the job. This script will automatically load the saved xml config file and run without any interface.
