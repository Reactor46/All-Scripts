.SYNOPSIS
	This script quick launches the UCS GUI from a saved credentials file.

.DESCRIPTION
	This script quick launches the UCS GUI from a saved credentials file.

.EXAMPLE
	Start-UcsGui.ps1
	This script can be run without any command line parameters.  User will be prompted for all parameters and options required

.EXAMPLE
	Start-UcsGui.ps1 -ucs "1.2.3.4" -savedcred "myucscred.csv"
	-ucs -- UCS Manager IP address or Host Name -- Example: "1.2.3.4" or "myucs" or "myucs.domain.local"
	-savedcred -- UCS Manager Credential File -- Add this option to locate a credentials file that is not located in the same folder as this script or named differently than myucscred.csv
		To create a credentials file: $credential = Get-Credential ; $credential | select username,@{Name="EncryptedPassword";Expression={ConvertFrom-SecureString $_.password}} |Export-CSV -NoTypeInformation .\myucscred.csv
		Make sure the password file is located in the same folder as the script
	All parameters are optional and any skipped will be prompted for during execution
	The only prompts that will always be presented would be for error recovery

.EXAMPLE
	Start-UcsGui.ps1 -ucs "1.2.3.4" -savedcred "myucscred.csv" -nossl
	-ucs -- UCS Manager IP address or Host Name -- Example: "1.2.3.4" or "myucs" or "myucs.domain.local"
	-savedcred -- UCS Manager Credential File -- Add this option to locate a credentials file that is not located in the same folder as this script or named differently than myucscred.csv
		To create a credentials file: $credential = Get-Credential ; $credential | select username,@{Name="EncryptedPassword";Expression={ConvertFrom-SecureString $_.password}} |Export-CSV -NoTypeInformation .\myucscred.csv
		Make sure the password file is located in the same folder as the script
	-nossl -- Launches UCSM GUI using HTTP instead of HTTPS
	All parameters are optional and any skipped will be prompted for during execution
	The only prompts that will always be presented would be for error recovery
