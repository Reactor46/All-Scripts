.SYNOPSIS
	This script will go through each of your blades and rack servers and provide a user label with a basic inventory description.

.DESCRIPTION
	This script will go through each of your blades and rack servers and provide a user label with a basic inventory description. Ex. - B200-M3 / 2 x E5-2660 / 256GB

.EXAMPLE
	Set-UcsServerInventoryLabels.ps1
	This script can be run without any command line parameters.  User will be prompted for all parameters and options required

.EXAMPLE
	Set-UcsServerInventoryLabels.ps1 -ucs "1.2.3.4" -ucred
	-ucs -- UCS Manager IP or Host Name -- Example: "1.2.3.4" or "myucs" or "myucs.domain.local" or "1.2.3.4,5.6.7.8" or "myucs1,myucs2" or "myucs1.domain.local,myucs2.domain.local"
	-ucred -- UCS Manager Credential Switch -- Adding this switch will immediately prompt you for your UCSM username and password
	All parameters are optional and any skipped will be prompted for during execution
	The only prompts that will always be presented to the user will be for User Names and Passwords
	
.EXAMPLE
	Set-UcsServerInventoryLabels.ps1 -ucs "1.2.3.4" -saved "myucscred.csv" -skiperrors
	-ucs -- UCS Manager IP or Host Name -- Example: "1.2.3.4" or "myucs" or "myucs.domain.local" or "1.2.3.4,5.6.7.8" or "myucs1,myucs2" or "myucs1.domain.local,myucs2.domain.local"
	-savedcred -- UCSM credentials file -- Example: -savedcred "myucscred.csv"
		To create a credentials file: $credential = Get-Credential ; $credential | select username,@{Name="EncryptedPassword";Expression={ConvertFrom-SecureString $_.password}} |Export-CSV -NoTypeInformation .\myucscred.csv
		Make sure the password file is located in the same folder as the script
	-skiperrors -- Tells the script to skip any prompts for errors and continues with 'y'
	All parameters are optional and any skipped will be prompted for during execution
	The only prompts that will always be presented to the user will be for User Names and Passwords
