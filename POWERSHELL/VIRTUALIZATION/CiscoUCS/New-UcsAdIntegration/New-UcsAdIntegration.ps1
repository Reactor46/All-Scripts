.SYNOPSIS
	This script configures LDAP integration to Microsoft Active Directory.

.DESCRIPTION
	This script configures LDAP integration to Microsoft Active Directory.
	Fill out the global variables section before running

.EXAMPLE
	New-UcsAdIntegration.ps1
	This script can be run without any command line parameters.  User will be prompted for all parameters and options required

.EXAMPLE
	New-UcsAdIntegration.ps1 -ucs "1.2.3.4" -ucred
	-ucs -- UCS Manager IP address(s) or Host Name(s) -- Example: "1.2.3.4" or "myucs" or "myucs.domain.local" or "1.2.3.4,5.6.7.8" or "myucs1,myucs2" or "myucs1.domain.local,myucs2.domain.local"
	-ucred -- UCS Manager Credential Switch -- Adding this switch will immediately prompt you for your UCSM username and password
	All parameters are optional and any skipped will be prompted for during execution
	The only prompts that will always be presented to the user will be for User Names and Passwords

.EXAMPLE
	New-UcsAdIntegration.ps1 -ucs "1.2.3.4" -saved "myucscred.csv" -skiperror
	-ucs -- UCS Manager IP address(s) or Host Name(s) -- Example: "1.2.3.4" or "myucs" or "myucs.domain.local" or "1.2.3.4,5.6.7.8" or "myucs1,myucs2" or "myucs1.domain.local,myucs2.domain.local"
	-savedcred -- UCSM credentials file -- Example: -savedcred "myucscred.csv"
		To create a credentials file: $credential = Get-Credential ; $credential | select username,@{Name="EncryptedPassword";Expression={ConvertFrom-SecureString $_.password}} |Export-CSV -NoTypeInformation .\myucscred.csv
		Make sure the password file is located in the same folder as the script
	-skiperrors -- Tells the script to skip any prompts for errors and continues with 'y'
	All parameters are optional and any skipped will be prompted for during execution
	The only prompts that will always be presented to the user will be for User Names and Passwords

#If your UCS is not configured for DNS, enter the DNS info below:
##Example: $DnsDomain = 'martin.local'
$DnsDomain = 'martin.local'

##Example: $DnsServers = @('10.0.1.101', '10.0.1.102', '10.0.1.119')
$DnsServers = @('10.0.1.101', '10.0.1.102', '10.0.1.119')


#If your UCS is not configured for NTP, enter the NTP info below:
##Example: $TimeZone = 'America/Los_Angeles (Pacific Time)'
$TimeZone = 'America/Los_Angeles (Pacific Time)'

##Example: $NtpServers = @('10.0.0.1', 'tick.usno.navy.mil', 'tock.usno.navy.mil')

#Global Variables for LDAP integration with Active Directory
##Example: $ProviderFQDN = 'martin.local'
###Enter your top level domain
$ProviderFQDN = 'martin.local'

##Example: $BindDn = 'CN=UCS Bind,OU=Service Accounts,DC=martin,DC=local'
###Enter the AD service account that will be used to access AD to validate credentials
####NOTE: Enter the user account first and last name, not the account name
$BindDn = 'CN=UCS Bind,OU=Service Accounts,DC=martin,DC=local'

##Example: $BaseDn = 'DC=martin,DC=local'
###This will be the top level domain info.  Recursion will be used to drill down into the domain
$BaseDn = 'DC=martin,DC=local'

##Example: $Filter = 'sAMAccountName=$userid'
###Do not change this value
$Filter = 'sAMAccountName=$userid'

##Example: $GroupMaps = @{'admin' = 'CN=UCS_Admins,OU=Service Accounts,DC=martin,DC=local' ; 'read-only' = 'CN=UCS_ReadOnly,OU=Service Accounts,DC=martin,DC=local'}
###This is the mapping of UCS roles to the AD security groups
####You will assign these security groups to the various users in your org who need access to UCS with various roles
$GroupMaps = @{'admin' = 'CN=UCS_Admins,OU=Service Accounts,DC=martin,DC=local' ; 'read-only' = 'CN=UCS_ReadOnly,OU=Service Accounts,DC=martin,DC=local'}
