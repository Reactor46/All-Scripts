SHORT DESCRIPTION
    AppD_Application is a prototype of Active Directory (AD) Built-In Administrator accounts security settings verification tool.

LONG DESCRIPTION
    AppD_Application is a set of Powershel Scripts that automates BA Accounts security settings assessment tasks.
    The application demonstrates how to verify programmatically that AD BA Accounts are configured in accordance with the 
    "Appendix D: Securing Built-In Administrator (BA) Accounts in Active Directory" article:
    https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server-docs/identity/ad-ds/plan/security-best-practices/appendix-d--securing-built-in-administrator-accounts-in-active-directory 

    To verify security settings for each domain in a forest the application enumerates:
    -- BA accounts settings  
    -- User rights assignments. 
    
    To perform last task the application:
    -- creates RSOP file for each domain
    -- parses these RSOP files and generates a report that includes BA accounts and a user rights assigned to them. 

    AppD_Application consists of these scripts:
    -- 01-EnumerateDomainsInForest.ps1
    -- 02-EnumerateDCsInForest
    -- 03-EnumerateComputersInForest.ps1
    -- 04-Report_BA_Account_Settings.ps1
    -- 05-CreateRSOPFiles.ps1
    -- 06-ReportUserRightsAssignments.ps1

    Each script creates a .csv file as an input for other AppD_Application scripts and/or for further analysis.
    
    Running these scripts assesses domain-based BA Accounts' properties:
        01-EnumerateDomainsInForest -> 04-Report_BA_Account_Settings.ps1

    These scripts collect user rights assignments settings for domain-based BA Accounts:
        02-EnumerateDCsInForest -> 03-EnumerateComputersInForest.ps1 -> 05-CreateRSOPFiles.ps1 -> 06-ReportUserRightsAssignments.ps1

    The AppD_Application was tested on a virtual AD Forest that contains a root domain and two child domains.
    It's assumed that Member Servers and Workstations are located in ServersOU and WorkstationsOU OUs and their subOUs.
    Find more details about the test virtual AD Forest in the "Appendix 1" below.

    The AppD_Application may be extended to cover other techniques contained in the 
    "Microsoft's Best Practices for Securing Active Directory" article (check a link in the SEE ALSO section).

    To "install" the AppD_Application:
    1.	download AppD_Application.zip file to your computer local drive.

    2.	unzip AppD_Application.zip file to your computer local drive. The "psAppD_4_Technet" folder and its "Data" subfolder will be created:
-- psAppD_4_Technet:
	02/22/2017  12:32 PM             2,504 01-EnumerateDomainsInForest.ps1
	02/22/2017  12:39 PM             3,950 02-EnumerateDCsInForest.ps1
	02/22/2017  02:03 AM             4,914 03-EnumerateComputersInForest.ps1
	02/22/2017  12:46 PM             3,326 04-Report_BA_Account_Settings.ps1
	03/05/2017  01:43 AM             7,226 05-CreateRSOPFiles.ps1
	02/22/2017  02:15 AM             5,265 06-ReportUserRightsAssignments.ps1
	03/14/2017  09:08 AM             4,301 About_AppD_Application.txt
	03/14/2017  09:08 AM    <DIR>          Data
    	
-- psAppD_4_Technet\Data:
	02/19/2017  02:24 AM               232 UserRightsAssignment.csv	

    3.	Run psAppD_4_Technet scripts :

    -- to enumerate domain-based BA Accounts' properties:
        01-EnumerateDomainsInForest -> 04-Report_BA_Account_Settings.ps1

    -- to collect user rights assignments settings for domain-based BA Accounts:
        02-EnumerateDCsInForest -> 03-EnumerateComputersInForest.ps1 -> 05-CreateRSOPFiles.ps1 -> 06-ReportUserRightsAssignments.ps1

    All scripts create reports in the psAppD_4_Technet\Data folder.

    Warning:
    -- scripts don't provide any error handling for open .CSV files

Appendix 1. A test virtual forest configured as follow:

root Domain 	us.local
DC		usdc		Windows 2008R2
Member server:	w12		Windows 2012R2
Member server:	w12al-ms	Windows 2012R2

Child doman1	ny.us.local	
DCs		nydc and nydc2	Windows 2012R2

Child doman2	la.us.local	
DCs		ladc		Windows 2012R2

All computers in the forest are virtual machines running on VMware Workstation Player.

All computers in the forest have Windows OS installed.

All domain controllers in each domain are located in the DCs OU and its subOUs

Client OUs (i.e. Astoria, Brooklyn, ...) in each domain include ServersOU and WorkstationsOU OUs
All member servers are located in the ServersOU and its subOUs
All workstations are located in the WorkstationsOU and its subOUs
