2. Pls download "ProjectPolicyItemList.stp" then upload it to the following "List Template Gallery", https://xxx.sharepoint.com/sites/xxx/_catalogs/lt/Forms/AllItems.aspx ("ProjectPolicyItemList.stp" actually comes from "list settings" > "save as template" of a OOTB working site)

# What can this scripts do?

Enable the site policy feature if it hasn't been enabled. Create ProjectPolicyItemList hidden list (Create a list from stp tempalte).

Microsoft doesn't provide production ready scripts, customers need to test/verify/develop this script by themselves. And this script is out of the support scope.
