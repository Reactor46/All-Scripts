2. Extract the contents of the NuGet package to a local folder.
3. Delete the NuGet-specific elements from the folder.
4. Rename the folder. The default folder name is usually name.version. The version can include -prerelease if the module is tagged as a prerelease version. Rename the folder to just the module name. For example, azurerm.storage.5.0.4-preview becomes azurerm.storage.
5. Copy the folder to one of the folders in the $env:PSModulePath value. $env:PSModulePath is a semicolon-delimited set of paths in which PowerShell should look for modules.
