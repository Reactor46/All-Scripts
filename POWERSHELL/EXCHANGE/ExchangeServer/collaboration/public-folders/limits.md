# Limits for public folders

In Exchange Server, public folders are based on a mailbox architecture that allows public folders to benefit from things such as the resiliency of a Database Availability Group (DAG) and other mailbox enhancements. However, there are limits and performance considerations that should be taken into account.
  
## Limits

The following table lists the limits for public folders in on-premises Exchange Server. Unless the limits are specifically stated as recommended, the values listed in this table are the supported limits for public folders.
