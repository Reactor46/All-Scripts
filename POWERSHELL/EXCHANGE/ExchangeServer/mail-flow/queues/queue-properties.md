# Queue properties in Exchange Server

Filtering queues by one or more queue properties in Exchange Server allows you to quickly find and take action on those queues. The following scenarios are examples of how you might use queue filtering to manage mail flow:
  
- You receive a message from System Center Operations Manager that indicates a queue length has exceeded the established threshold. You want to investigate whether a server-wide mail flow problem exists.
    
    You create a filter to view all the queues on a server whose message count exceeds what you consider to be typical. If a mail flow problem is indicated, you can select all the queues in the results and suspend the queues while you continue to investigate.
    
- You suspend several queues to investigate the cause of mail flow problems. You determine that the problem was caused by an incorrect connector configuration that is now fixed.
    
    You can create a filter to view all the queues that have a status of Suspended, and then select all the queues in the filter results and resume the queues.
    
You can create queue filters in Queue Viewer in the Exchange Toolbox, or by using the _Filter_ parameter on the queue management cmdlets. Note that the queue management cmdlets support more filterable properties than Queue Viewer.
  
For more information about Queue Viewer, see [Queue Viewer](queue-viewer.md). For more information about the queue management cmdlets, see [Procedures for queues](queue-procedures.md) and [Find queues and messages in queues in the Exchange Management Shell](queues-and-messages-in-powershell.md).
  
## Queue properties to use as filters

 The following table describes the queue properties that you can use as filters in Queue Viewer and the Exchange Management Shell.
  
|**Queue Viewer**|**Exchange Management Shell**|**Comparison operators**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
|n/a  <br/> | `DeferredMessageCount` <br/> |Equals (`-eq`)  <br/> Does not equal (`-ne`)  <br/> Greater than (`-gt`)  <br/> Greater than or equal to (`-ge`)  <br/> Less than (`-lt`)  <br/> Less than or equal to (`-le`)  <br/> |The number of messages returned to the Submission queue because of transient errors that were encountered during recipient resolution. For more information about deferred messages, see [Recipient resolution in Exchange Server](../../mail-flow/mail-routing/recipient-resolution.md).  <br/> |
|n/a  <br/> | `DDeferredMessageCountsPerPriority` <br/> |Equals (`-eq`)  <br/> Does Not Equal (`-ne`)  <br/> Contains (`-like`)  <br/> |An array that shows the number of deferred messages in the queue by priority (importance) value. The **MessageCountsPerPriority** property shows what each number means.  <br/> For example, the value `{1, 5, 10, 0}` indicates the queue contains 1 deferred High priority message, 5 deferred Normal priority messages, 10 deferred Low priority messages, and no deferred messages that have the priority value None.  <br/> |
|**Delivery Type** <br/> | `DeliveryType` <br/> |**Equals** (`-eq`)  <br/> **Does Not Equal** (`-ne`)  <br/> |The results of the categorization of the message, and how the Transport service intends to transmit the message to the next hop. For a list of the available **DeliveryType** values, see [NextHopSolutionKey](queues.md#nexthopsolutionkey).  <br/> |
