# Connection filtering procedures on Edge Transport servers

Connection filtering is an antispam feature that's provided by the Connection Filtering agent, which is available only on Edge Transport servers in Exchange Server. Connection filtering enables the following features:

- IP Block list

- IP Block List providers

- IP Allow list

- IP Allow List providers

Each of these features can be enabled or disabled separately.

For more information about connection filtering, see [Connection filtering on Edge Transport servers](connection-filtering.md).

## What do you need to know before you begin?

- Estimated time to complete each procedure: 5 minutes.

- You need to be assigned permissions before you can perform this procedure or procedures. To see what permissions you need, see the "Antispam features" entry in the [Antispam and antimalware permissions](../../permissions/feature-permissions/antispam-and-antimalware-permissions.md) topic.

- You can only use PowerShell to perform this procedure. To learn how to open the Exchange Management Shell in your on-premises Exchange organization, see [Open the Exchange Management Shell](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/exchange-server/open-the-exchange-management-shell).

- For information about keyboard shortcuts that may apply to the procedures in this topic, see [Keyboard shortcuts in the Exchange admin center](../../about-documentation/exchange-admin-center-keyboard-shortcuts.md).

> [!TIP]
> Having problems? Ask for help in the Exchange forums. Visit the forums at: [Exchange Server](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkId=60612), [Exchange Online](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkId=267542), or [Exchange Online Protection](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkId=285351).

## Use the Exchange Management Shell to enable or disable connection filtering

To completely enable or disable connection filtering, you enable or disable the Connection Filtering agent. The change takes effect after you restart the Microsoft Exchange Transport service. When you restart the Microsoft Exchange service on an Edge Transport server, mail flow on the server is temporarily interrupted.

To disable connection filtering, run the following command:

```
Disable-TransportAgent "Connection Filtering Agent"
```

To enable connection filtering, run the following command:

```
Enable-TransportAgent "Connection Filtering Agent"
```

To make the change take effect, restart the Microsoft Exchange Transport service by running the following command:

```
Restart-Service MSExchangeTransport
```

### How do you know this worked?

To verify that you successfully enabled or disabled connection filtering, run the following command to verify the **Enabled** property value.

```
Get-TransportAgent "Connection Filtering Agent" | Format-List Enabled
```

## IP Block list procedures

These procedures apply to the IP Block list that you manually configure. They don't apply to IP Block List providers.

Use the **IPBlockListConfig** cmdlets to view and configure how connection filtering uses the IP Block list. Use the **IPBlockListEntry** cmdlets to view and configure the IP addresses in the IP Block list.

### Use the Exchange Management Shell to view the configuration of the IP Block list

To view the configuration of the IP Block list, run the following command:

```
Get-IPBlockListConfig | Format-List *Enabled,*Response
```

### Use the Exchange Management Shell to enable or disable the IP Block list

To disable the IP Block list, run the following command:

```
Set-IPBlockListConfig -Enabled $false
```

To enable the IP Block list, run the following command:

```
Set-IPBlockListConfig -Enabled $true
```

For more information, see [Set-IPBlockListConfig](http://technet.microsoft.com/library/87e30029-0349-4d9a-a9a4-cb25686ccb7c.aspx).

#### How do you know this worked?

To verify that you successfully enabled or disabled the IP Block list, run the following command to verify the **Enabled** property value.

```
Get-IPBlockListConfig | Format-List Enabled
```

### Use the Exchange Management Shell to configure the IP Block list

To configure the IP Block list, use the following syntax:

```
Set-IPBlockListConfig [-ExternalMailEnabled <$true | $false>] [-InternalMailEnabled <$true | $false> -MachineEntryRejectionResponse "<Custom response text>"] [-StaticEntryRejectionResponse "<Custom response text>"]
```

This example configures the IP Block list with the following settings:

- The IP Block list filters incoming connections from internal and external mail servers. By default, connections are filtered from external mail servers only (_ExternalMailEnabled_ is set to `$true`, and _InternalMailEnabled_ is set to `$false`). Non-authenticated connections and authenticated connections from external partners are considered external.

- The custom response text for connections that were filtered by IP addresses that were automatically added to the IP Block list by the sender reputation feature of the Protocol Analysis agent is set to the value "Connection from IP address {0} was rejected by sender reputation."

- The custom response text for connections that were filtered by IP addresses that were manually added to the IP Block list is set to the value "Connection from IP address {0} was rejected by connection filtering."

```
Set-IPBlockListConfig -InternalMailEnabled $true -MachineEntryRejectionResponse "Connection from IP address {0} was rejected by sender reputation." -StaticEntryRejectionResponse "Connection from IP address {0} was rejected by connection filtering."
```

For more information, see [Set-IPBlockListConfig](http://technet.microsoft.com/library/87e30029-0349-4d9a-a9a4-cb25686ccb7c.aspx).

#### How do you know this worked?

To verify that you successfully configured the IP Block list, run the following command to verify the property values.

```
Get-IPBlockListConfig | Format-List *MailEnabled,*Response
```

### Use the Exchange Management Shell to view IP Block list entries

To view all IP Block list entries, run the following command:

```
Get-IPBlockListEntry
```

Note that each IP Block list entry is identified by an integer value. The identity integer is assigned in ascending order when you add entries to the IP Block list and the IP Allow list.

To view a specific IP Block list entry, use the following syntax:

```
Get-IPBlockListEntry <-Identity IdentityInteger | -IPAddress IPAddress>
```

For example, to view the IP Block list entry that contains the IP address 192.168.1.13, run the following command:

```
Get-IPBlockListEntry -IPAddress 192.168.1.13
```

For more information, see [Get-IPBlockListEntry](http://technet.microsoft.com/library/efdf2bc1-5571-417e-810a-b690bf5c8044.aspx).

> [!NOTE]
> When you use the _IPAddress_ parameter, the resulting IP Block list entry can be an individual IP address, an IP address range, or a Classless InterDomain Routing (CIDR) IP. To use the _Identity_ parameter, you specify the integer value that's assigned to the IP Block list entry.

### Use the Exchange Management Shell to add IP Block list entries

To add IP Block list entries, use the following syntax:

```
Add-IPBlockListEntry <-IPAddress IPAddress | -IPRange IP range or CIDR IP> [-ExpirationTime <DateTime>] [-Comment "<Descriptive Comment>"]
```

This example adds the IP Block list entry for the IP address range 192.168.1.10 through 192.168.1.15 and configures the IP Block list entry to expire on July 4, 2018 at 15:00.

```
Add-IPBlockListEntry -IPRange 192.168.1.10-192.168.1.15 -ExpirationTime "7/4/2018 15:00"
```

For more information, see [Add-IPBlockListEntry](http://technet.microsoft.com/library/02ff6f8f-3090-46b9-9e58-131239a75ad3.aspx).

#### How do you know this worked?

To verify that you successfully added an IP Block list entry, run the following command and verify that the new IP Block list entry is displayed.

```
Get-IPBlockListEntry
```

### Use the Exchange Management Shell to remove IP Block list entries

To remove IP Block list entries, use the following syntax:

```
Remove-IPBlockListEntry <IdentityInteger>
```

This example removes the IP Block list entry that has the _Identity_ value 3.

```
Remove-IPBlockListEntry 3
```

This example removes the IP Block list entry that contains the IP address 192.168.1.12 without using the _Identity_ integer value. Note that the IP Block list entry can be an individual IP address or an IP address range.

```
Get-IPBlockListEntry -IPAddress 192.168.1.12 | Remove-IPBlockListEntry
```

For more information, see [Remove-IPBlockListEntry](http://technet.microsoft.com/library/c72aef06-68fd-47ba-a9ac-9984e31d13e4.aspx).

#### How do you know this worked?

To verify that you successfully removed an IP Block list entry, run the following command and verify that the IP Block list entry you removed is gone.

```
Get-IPBlockListEntry
```

## IP Block List provider procedures

These procedures apply to IP Block List providers. They don't apply to the IP Block list.

Use the **IPBlockListProvidersConfig** cmdlets to view and configure how connection filtering uses all IP Block List providers. Use the **IPBlockListProvider** cmdlets to view, configure, and test IP Block List providers.

### Use the Exchange Management Shell to view the configuration of all IP Block List providers

```
Set-IPBlockListProvidersConfig [-BypassedRecipients <recipient1,recipient2...>] [-ExternalMailEnabled <$true | $false>] [-InternalMailEnabled <$true | $false>]
```

This example configures all IP Block List providers with the following settings:

- IP Block List providers filter incoming connections from internal and external mail servers. By default, connections are filtered from external mail servers only (_ExternalMailEnabled_ is set to `$true`, and _InternalMailEnabled_ is set to `$false`). Non-authenticated connections and authenticated connections from external partners are considered external.

- Messages sent to the internal recipients chris@fabrikam.com and michelle@fabrikam.com are excluded from filtering by IP Block List providers. Note that if you want to add recipients to the list without affecting existing recipients, use the syntax, `@{Add="<recipient1>","<recipient2>"...}`.

```
Set-IPBlockListProvidersConfig -BypassedRecipients chris@fabrikam.com,michelle@fabrikam.com -InternalMailEnabled $true
```

For more information, see [Set-IPBlockListProvidersConfig](http://technet.microsoft.com/library/6076c434-e162-4398-81d6-6b9e92e2bf99.aspx).
