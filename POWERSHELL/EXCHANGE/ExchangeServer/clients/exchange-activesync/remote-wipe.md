If one of your users loses their mobile phone, you can use the Exchange admin center (EAC) or the Exchange Management Shell to wipe their phone clean of all corporate and user information.

2. Select the user, and under **Mobile Devices**, choose **View details**.
    
3. On the **Mobile Device Details** page, select the lost mobile device, and then select **Wipe Data**.
    
4. Select **Save**.
    
## Use the Exchange Management Shell to wipe a user's phone

You can use the **Clear-MobileDevice** cmdlet in the Exchange Management Shell to wipe a user's phone.
