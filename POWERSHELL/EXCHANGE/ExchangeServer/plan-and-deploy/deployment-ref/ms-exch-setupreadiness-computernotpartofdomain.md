# The local computer isn't joined to an Active Directory domain [ComputerNotPartofDomain]

Exchange Setup can't continue because it detected that the target server isn't a member of an Active Directory domain. You need to join the target server to an Active Directory domain before you can install the Mailbox server role. You might also see this message if you're using a local computer account instead of a domain user account (with the required permissions) to install Exchange.
  
For more information, see [Exchange Server system requirements](../system-requirements.md)
  
Having problems? Ask for help in the Exchange forums. Visit the forums at: [Exchange Server](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkId=60612).
