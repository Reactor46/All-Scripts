# The logged-on user is not a member of the Schema Admins group [SchemaUpdateRequired]

Exchange Setup can't continue because the user account isn't a member of the Schema Admins and Enterprise Admins security groups.

Setup requires that the account you're using to install Exchange has permissions to create and modify objects in Active Directory:

- If this is the first Exchange server in your organizaiton, your account needs to be a member of the Schema Admins security group (to extend the schema) and the Enterprise Admins security group (to prepare Active Directory).

- After you prepare Active Directory for the version of Exchange that you're installing, your account needs to be a member of the Organization Management role group.

For more information, see [Prepare Active Directory and domains for Exchange](../prepare-ad-and-domains.md).
 
To resolve this issue, run Exchange setup again using an account that has the appropriate permissions (grant permissions to the current account or use a different account).
 
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Cross-forest installation of Exchange isn't supported. Use an account in the Active Directory forest where you're installing Exchange.
