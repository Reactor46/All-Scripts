# Failover Cluster Command Interface Windows feature not installed [RsatClusteringCmdInterfaceInstalled]

Microsoft Exchange Server 2016 Setup can't continue because the local computer is missing a required Windows feature. You'll need to install this Windows feature before Exchange 2016 can continue.

Do the following to install the Windows feature on this computer. If the feature requires a reboot to complete installation, you'll need to exit Exchange 2016 Setup, reboot, and then start Setup again.
  
> [!NOTE]
> Additional Windows features or updates might need to be installed before Exchange 2016 Setup can continue. For a complete list of required Windows features and updates, check out [Exchange Server prerequisites](../../plan-and-deploy/prerequisites.md).
