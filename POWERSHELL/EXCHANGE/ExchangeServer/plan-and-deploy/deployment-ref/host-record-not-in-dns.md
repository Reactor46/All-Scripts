# The Host record for the local computer cannot be found in the DNS database [HostRecordMissing]

Exchange Setup can't continue because the Host (A) record for this computer can't be found in the DNS zone for the domain. Setup requires a vaild A record for the server, and Exchange uses email server A records to find the IP address of the next hop to send messages.
  
To resolve this issue:
  
- Verify that the local TCP/IP configuration points to the correct DNS server. For more information, see [Configure TCP/IP settings](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=108281).
    
- Use Nslookup.exe to verify that the Host (A) record exists on the DNS server. For more information, see [To verify A resource records exist in DNS](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=63001).
    
For information about DNS name resolution, troubleshooting, and A records, see the following:
  
- [Troubleshooting DNS](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=294828)
    
- [Managing resource records](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=294829)

Having problems? Ask for help in the Exchange forums. Visit the forums at: [Exchange Server](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkId=60612).
