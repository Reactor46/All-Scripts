#MailFlowHeatMap.ps1 - Mail flow latency heat map generation script.

Generates a HTML report of the mail flow latency between mailbox servers in the organization. This script was mainly developed as a way to test HTML colors, and was first developed in an Exchange 2007 environment. It may not work with the latest versions of Exchange Server.

##Usage
```
PS C:\Scripts> .\MailFlowHeatMap.ps1
```

Generates the mail flow heat map file. See **example.jpg** in this repo for an example of what the report looks like.
