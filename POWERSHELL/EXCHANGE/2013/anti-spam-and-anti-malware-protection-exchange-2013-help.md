# Anti-spam and anti-malware protection

 

_**Applies to:** Exchange Server 2013_


Microsoft Exchange Server 2013 customers are automatically provided with anti-spam and anti-malware protection. The following topics (and their associated subtopics) provide overview information and configuration steps for customizing the built-in spam filtering and malware filtering settings so that they best meet the needs of your organization:

[Anti-spam protection](anti-spam-protection-exchange-2013-help.md)   Describes the basic built-in anti-spam protection features as well as other anti-spam protection options such as using a cloud-hosted anti-spam solution and managing quarantined messages.

[Anti-malware protection](anti-malware-protection-exchange-2013-help.md)   Describes the basic built-in anti-malware protection features as well as other anti-malware protection options. Among the information included are an Anti-Malware FAQ and details about how to configure anti-malware settings using the Exchange Administration Center or the Exchange Management Shell.

If you're looking for information about anti-spam features of Office 365, see [Office 365 Email Anti-Spam Protection](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/office-365-email-anti-spam-protection-6a601501-a6a8-4559-b2e7-56b59c96a586?ui=en-us%26rs=en-us%26ad=us).
