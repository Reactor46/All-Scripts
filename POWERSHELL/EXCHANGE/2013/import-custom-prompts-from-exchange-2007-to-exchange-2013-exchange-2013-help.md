# Import custom prompts from Exchange 2007 to Exchange 2013

 

_**Applies to:** Exchange Server 2013_


You can import the audio files that contain custom greetings, announcements, menus, and prompts from Exchange 2007 Unified Messaging (UM) to Exchange 2013 Unified Messaging. Using a Shell script, the prompts are imported into an Exchange system mailbox named {e0dc1c29-89c3-4034-b678-e6c29d823ed9}, which is created when you install Microsoft Exchange 2013. This system mailbox is used in Unified Messaging to store dial plan and auto attendant custom greetings, announcements, menus, prompts, and UM reports.

The audio files, in .wav or .wma format, are used as follows:

  - On UM dial plans, audio files are used for customized welcome greetings and informational announcements. They’re played when Outlook Voice Access users call in to an Outlook Voice Access number.

  - On UM auto attendants, audio files are used for customized non-business and business hours greetings, informational announcements, menu prompts, and navigation menus. They’re played when callers call in to a UM auto attendant.

You use the MigrateUMCustomPrompts.ps1 script to migrate a copy of all Exchange Server 2007 UM custom greetings, announcements, menus, and prompts to Exchange 2013 UM for all Exchange 2007 UM dial plans and UM auto attendants.

By default, the MigrateUMCustomPrompts.ps1 script is located in the \<Program Files\>\\Microsoft\\Exchange Server\\V15\\Scripts folder on an Exchange 2013 server.


> [!NOTE]
> The MigrateUMCustomPrompts.ps1 script is included with Exchange 2013. It must be run on an Exchange 2013 Mailbox server in the same organization with your Exchange 2007 UM servers.

For additional management tasks related to UM auto attendants, see [UM auto attendant procedures](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/exchange/voice-mail-unified-messaging/automatically-answer-and-route-calls/um-auto-attendant-procedures).
