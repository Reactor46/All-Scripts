# Permanently delete a mailbox

_**Applies to:** Exchange Online, Exchange Server 2013_


When you permanently delete active mailboxes and disconnected mailboxes, all mailbox contents are purged from the Exchange mailbox database, and the data loss is permanent. When you permanently delete an active mailbox, the associated Active Directory user account is also deleted.

An alternative to permanently deleting a mailbox is to disconnect it. After you disconnect a mailbox, by default, it’s retained in the mailbox database for 30 days. This gives you the opportunity to reconnect or restore a mailbox before it’s purged from the database.

To learn more about disconnected mailboxes and perform other related management tasks, see the following topics:

  - [Disconnected mailboxes](disconnected-mailboxes-exchange-2013-help.md)

  - [Disable or delete a mailbox](disable-or-delete-a-mailbox-exchange-2013-help.md)

  - [Connect a disabled mailbox](connect-a-disabled-mailbox-exchange-2013-help.md)

  - [Connect or restore a deleted mailbox](connect-or-restore-a-deleted-mailbox-exchange-2013-help.md)


> [!NOTE]  
> You can't use the EAC to permanently delete an active mailbox or a disconnected mailbox.

## What do you want to do?

## Permanently delete an active mailbox

## Use the Shell to permanently delete an active mailbox

Run the following command to permanently delete an active mailbox and the associated Active Directory user account.

```powershell
Remove-Mailbox -Identity <identity> -Permanent $true
```

> [!NOTE]  
> If you don’t include the <EM>Permanent</EM> parameter, the deleted mailbox is retained in the mailbox database for 30 days, by default, before it’s permanently deleted.



For detailed syntax and parameter information, see [Remove-Mailbox](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa995948\(v=exchg.150\)).

## How do you know this worked?

To verify that you’ve permanently deleted an active mailbox, do the following:

1.  Verify that the mailbox is no longer listed in the EAC.

2.  Verify that the associated user account is no longer listed in Active Directory Users and Computers.

3.  Run the following command to verify that the mailbox was successfully purged from the Exchange mailbox database.
    
    ```powershell
    Get-MailboxDatabase | Get-MailboxStatistics | Where {         Get-MailboxDatabase | Get-MailboxStatistics | Where { $_.DisplayName -eq "<display name>" }.DisplayName -eq "<display name>" }
    ```
    
    If you successfully purged the mailbox, the command won’t return any results. If the mailbox wasn’t purged, the command will return information about the mailbox.

## Permanently delete a disconnected mailbox

## Use the Shell to permanently delete a disconnected mailbox

There are two types of disconnected mailboxes: disabled and soft-deleted. You must specify one of these types when running the cmdlet to permanently delete the mailbox. If the type you specify doesn't match the actual type of the disconnected mailbox, the command fails.

Run the following command to determine whether a disconnected mailbox is disabled or soft-deleted.

```powershell
Get-MailboxDatabase | Get-MailboxStatistics | Where { $_.DisplayName -eq "<display name>" } | fl DisplayName,MailboxGuid,Database,DisconnectReason
```

The value for the *DisconnectReason* property for disconnected mailboxes will be either `Disabled` or `SoftDeleted`.

You can run the following command to display the type for all disconnected mailboxes in your organization.

```powershell
Get-MailboxDatabase | Get-MailboxStatistics | Where { $_.DisconnectReason -ne $null } | fl DisplayName,MailboxGuid,Database,DisconnectReason
```

> [!WARNING]  
> When you use the <STRONG>Remove-StoreMailbox</STRONG> cmdlet to permanently delete a disconnected mailbox, all its contents are purged from the mailbox database and the data loss is permanent.

This example permanently deletes the disabled mailbox with the GUID 2ab32ce3-fae1-4402-9489-c67e3ae173d3 from mailbox database MBD01.

```powershell
Remove-StoreMailbox -Database MBD01 -Identity "2ab32ce3-fae1-4402-9489-c67e3ae173d3" -MailboxState Disabled
```

This example permanently deletes the soft-deleted mailbox for Dan Jump from mailbox database MBD01.

```powershell
Remove-StoreMailbox -Database MBD01 -Identity "Dan Jump" -MailboxState SoftDeleted
```

This example permanently deletes all soft-deleted mailboxes from mailbox database MBD01.

```powershell
Get-MailboxStatistics -Database MBD01 | where {$_.DisconnectReason -eq "SoftDeleted"} | ForEach {Remove-StoreMailbox -Database $_.Database -Identity $_.MailboxGuid -MailboxState SoftDeleted}
```

For detailed syntax and parameter information, see [Remove-StoreMailbox](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff829913\(v=exchg.150\)) and [Get-MailboxStatistics](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb124612\(v=exchg.150\)).

## How do you know this worked?

To verify that you’ve permanently deleted a disconnected mailbox and that it was successfully purged from the Exchange mailbox database, run the following command.

```powershell
Get-MailboxDatabase | Get-MailboxStatistics | Where {     Get-MailboxDatabase | Get-MailboxStatistics | Where { $_.DisplayName -eq "<display name>" }.DisplayName -eq "<display name>" }
```

If you successfully purged the mailbox, the command won’t return any results. If the mailbox wasn’t purged, the command will return information about the mailbox.
