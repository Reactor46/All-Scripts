# Configure activation policy for a mailbox database copy

 

_**Applies to:** Exchange Server 2013_


*Activation* is the process of changing a mailbox database copy from a passive copy to an active copy. Activation occurs automatically by the system as part of a database or server failover operation, and it can be performed manually by an administrator as part of a database or server switchover operation. Blocking a database for activation prevents it from becoming the active copy during a database or server failover.

## What do you want to do?

## Use the EAC to configure the activation policy for a mailbox database copy

1.  In the EAC, go to **Servers** \> **Databases**.

2.  Select the database that you want to configure.

3.  In the Details pane, under **Database Copies**, locate the database copy you want to configure and click **Suspend**.

4.  Optionally, add a comment, and select the check box that says **This copy can only be activated by manual intervention**.

5.  Click **Save** to save the configuration changes for the mailbox database copy.

## Use the Shell to suspend or resume a database copy for activation

This example blocks the copy of the database DB1 on the server MBX2 for activation.

```powershell
Suspend-MailboxDatabaseCopy -Identity DB1\MBX2 -ActivationOnly
```

This example resumes the copy of the database DB1 on the server MBX2 for activation.

```powershell
Resume-MailboxDatabaseCopy -Identity DB1\MBX2
```

For detailed syntax and parameter information, see [Suspend-MailboxDatabaseCopy](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd351074\(v=exchg.150\)) or [Resume-MailboxDatabaseCopy](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd335220\(v=exchg.150\)).

## Use the Shell to configure the activation policy for a server

This example configures the database copies on server MBX2 as blocked for activation.

```powershell
Set-MailboxServer -Identity MBX2 -DatabaseCopyAutoActivationPolicy Blocked
```

This example configures the database copies on server MBX3 as blocked for out-of-site activation.

```powershell
Set-MailboxServer -Identity MBX3 -DatabaseCopyAutoActivationPolicy IntrasiteOnly
```

This example configures the database copies on server MBX4 as unblocked for activation.

```powershell
Set-MailboxServer -Identity MBX4 -DatabaseCopyAutoActivationPolicy Unrestricted
```

For detailed syntax and parameter information, see [Suspend-MailboxDatabaseCopy](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd351074\(v=exchg.150\)), [Resume-MailboxDatabaseCopy](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd335220\(v=exchg.150\)), or [Set-MailboxServer](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa998651\(v=exchg.150\)).

## How do you know this worked?

To verify that you've successfully configured the activation policy, do one of the following:

  - In the Shell, run the following command to verify activation settings for a database copy.
    
    ```powershell
    Get-MailboxDatabaseCopyStatus <DatabaseCopyName> | Format-List ActivationSuspended
    ```

  - In the Shell, run the following command to verify activation settings for a DAG member.
    
    ```powershell
    Get-MailboxServer <ServerName> | Format-List DatabaseCopyAutoActivationPolicy
    ```
