Microsoft® Exchange Server 2007 Disaster Recovery setup cannot continue because Disaster Recovery setup cannot access the mailbox database drive specification that was used in the previous installation of this server.

Microsoft Exchange Disaster Recovery setup requires that the same mailbox database drive specifications previously used for this server be available during the restore.

To resolve this situation, configure the drives to match the original logical drive configuration and rerun Microsoft Exchange Disaster Recovery setup.
