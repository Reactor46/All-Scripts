# Recipients in Exchange Online

In Exchange Online, the Exchange admin center (EAC) has replaced the Exchange Control Panel (ECP) as the GUI-based administrative tool used to manage cloud-based recipients. The EAC also replaces the Exchange Management Console in Exchange Server. For more information, see [Exchange admin center](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/a9aea11a-6ba3-4f4a-a76e-79072e7cfc7d.aspx).
  
## Managing recipients in Exchange Online

Although the EAC has a different look and feel than the ECP, managing Exchange Online recipients in the EAC is similar to managing recipients in the current version of Exchange Online. And because you use the EAC in both Exchange Online and Exchange on-premises organizations, managing cloud-based recipients is similar to managing on-premises recipients. For more information about managing some of the different types of recipients in Exchange Online, see the following articles:
