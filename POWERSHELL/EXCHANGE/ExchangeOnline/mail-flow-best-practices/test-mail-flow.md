# Test mail flow by validating your Office 365 connectors

To validate and troubleshoot mail flow from Office 365 to your organization's email server (also called on-premises server), validate your connectors. You can set up and validate connectors on the **connectors** page in the Exchange admin center (EAC). The built-in validation tests that your mail flow from Office 365 reaches: 
  
- Your organization's email server
    
- A partner organization.
    
For more information, see [Validate connectors in Office 365](use-connectors-to-configure-mail-flow/validate-connectors.md)
  
Mail flow issues can also happen when your MX record is not setup correctly. To verify your MX record, see [Find and fix issues after adding your domain or DNS records in Office 365](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=624017).
  
> [!NOTE]
> These tests replace Office 365 mail flow troubleshooting that was previously available in the [Remote Connectivity Analyzer](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=154308).
