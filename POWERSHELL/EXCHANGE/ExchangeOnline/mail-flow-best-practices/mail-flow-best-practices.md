Office 365 gives you flexibility in determining the best arrangement for how email is delivered to your organization's mailboxes. The path email takes from the Internet to a mailbox and vice versa is called mail flow. Most organizations want Office 365 to manage all their mailboxes and filtering, and some organizations need more complex mail flow setups to make sure that they comply with specific regulatory or business needs. If you're part of a small business or simply an organization that wants Office 365 to manage all your mailboxes and mail flow, we recommend following the steps in [Set up Office 365 for business](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=522378). That article provides a complete checklist for setting up Office 365 services and programs, including how to set up your mail flow and email clients.

We especially recommend reading the part about SPF records because customers often list the wrong values in their SPF record, which can cause mail flow problems.

## Introduction to the basics of Office 365 mail flow
<a name="BKMK_IntroductionToMailFlow"> </a>

Office 365 uses domains, like contoso.com, to route email messages. When you set up email in Office 365, you typically switch from the default domain that you got when you first signed up for Office 365 (the domain ending with .onmicrosoft.com) to your organization's domain. Domain names, like contoso.com, are managed by using a worldwide system of domain registrars (for example, GoDaddy, HostGator, or Moniker) and databases called the Domain Name System (DNS). DNS provides a mapping between human-readable computer hostnames and the IP addresses used by networking equipment. If you're new to DNS, we recommend that you read [DNS basics](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=528444). The following video provides you with a quick overview of some of the most important concepts about what DNS is and how it works.

### Understanding how DNS records control mail flow

In Office 365 mail flow, two DNS records are particularly important: MX records and SPF records.
  
 **MX (mail exchanger) records** provide an easy way for mail servers to know where to send email. You can think of the MX record as a type of postal address. If you want Office 365 to receive all email addressed to anyone@contoso.com, the MX record for contoso.com should point to Office 365, and it will look like the following example: 
  
```
Hostname: contoso-com.mail.protection.outlook.com
Priority: 0
TTL: 1 hour
```

 **SPF (sender policy framework) records** are a specially formatted TXT record in DNS. SPF records make sure that only the organization that owns a domain is actually sending email from that domain. SPF is basically a security measure to make sure someone doesn't impersonate another organization. (This impersonation is often called spoofing.) As a domain owner, you can use an SPF record to publish a list of IP addresses or subnets that are authorized to send email on your organization's behalf. This can be helpful if you want to send email from multiple servers or services with different IP addresses. The SPF record for an organization's domain that uses Office 365 to send all their mail should look like the following example:
  
```
v=spf1 include:spf.protection.outlook.com -all
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You can only have one SPF record per domain. Having multiple SPF records will invalidate all SPF records and cause mail flow problems. 
  
The SPF record configuration in the previous example tells the recipient email servers that email sent from Office 365's IP addresses are authorized for the domain. Because most modern email servers look up a domain's SPF record before they accept any email from it, it's important to set up a valid SPF record in DNS when you first set up mail flow.
  
### How MX records affect spam filtering

For the best mail flow experience-especially for spam filtering—we recommend pointing the MX record for your organization's domain to Office 365. Spam scanning is the initial connection point to the Office 365 service. Who is sending the message, the IP address of the server that originally sent the message, and the behavior of the connecting mail server, all help determine whether a message is legitimate or spam. If your domain's MX record doesn't point to Office 365, the spam filters won't be as effective. If your MX record doesn't point to Office 365, there will be some valid messages that the service misclassifies as spam and some spam messages that the service misclassifies as legitimate email.
  
With that said, there are legitimate business scenarios that require your domain's MX record to point to somewhere other than Office 365. For example, email destined for your organization might need to initially arrive at another destination (such as a third-party archiving solution), then route through Office 365, and then be delivered to mailboxes on your organization's mail server. This setup might provide the best solution to meet your business requirements.
  
Whatever your needs, this guide will help you understand how your MX records, SPF records, and, potentially, connectors need to be set up.
