# Set mailbox features for Outlook Voice Access users

Outlook Voice Access contains two interfaces: a telephone user interface (TUI) and a voice user interface (VUI). You can configure a UM-enabled user's TUI settings when the user accesses a mailbox using the Unified Messaging (UM) system in Exchange Server. When you modify a UM-enabled user's TUI settings on a UM mailbox policy, the changes affect all users who are associated with the UM mailbox policy. You can modify the following TUI settings on a UM mailbox policy:
  
- PIN-less access to voice mail
    
- Voice responses to other messages
    
- TUI access to their calendar
    
- TUI access to the directory
    
- TUI access to their email
    
- TUI access to their personal contacts
    
> [!NOTE]
> You can use only Exchange Online PowerShell to modify the Outlook Voice Access TUI settings for UM-enabled users. 
  
For additional management tasks related to UM mailbox policies, see [UM mailbox policy procedures](../../voice-mail-unified-messaging/set-up-voice-mail/um-mailbox-policy-procedures.md).
