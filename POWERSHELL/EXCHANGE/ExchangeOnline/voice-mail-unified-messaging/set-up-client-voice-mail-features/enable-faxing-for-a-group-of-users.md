# Enable faxing for a group of users

You can enable inbound faxes for users linked with a Unified Messaging (UM) mailbox policy. By default, when you enable users for Unified Messaging, users can't receive fax messages until you specify the URI for the fax partner server, deploy a fax partner server for your organization, and enable faxing on a UM mailbox policy. If the option to allow incoming faxes is disabled on the UM dial plan, the users linked with the UM mailbox policy still won't be able to receive faxes. Similarly, if the option to allow incoming faxes is disabled on an individual user, that user won't be able to receive faxes.
