# Disable common PIN patterns for voice mail

You can enable or disable common Unified Messaging (UM) PIN patterns for Outlook Voice Access users. If you enable or disable the common PIN patterns setting on a UM mailbox policy, the setting will apply to all UM-enabled users associated with the UM mailbox policy. By default, UM-enabled users can't use common patterns when they create a PIN.
  
You can configure several PIN-related settings on a UM mailbox policy. The **Allow Common PIN Patterns** setting is used to allow or prevent the use of common number patterns when users create a PIN. By default, this setting is disabled and prevents users from using the following number patterns: 
  
- **Sequential numbers**: These are PIN values that include only consecutive numbers. Examples of consecutive numbers for a PIN are 1234 and 65432. 
    
- **Repeated numbers**: These are PIN values that include only repeated numbers. Examples of repeated numbers are 11111 and 22222. 
    
- **Suffix of mailbox extension**: These are PIN values that include the suffix of a user's mailbox extension. For example, if a user's mailbox extension is 36697, the user's PIN cannot be 3669712. 
    
> [!NOTE]
> If the **Allow Common PIN Patterns** setting is enabled, only the suffix of the mailbox extension will be rejected. 
  
For additional tasks related to Outlook Voice Access PIN security, see [PIN security procedures](pin-security-procedures.md).

2. On the **UM Dial Plan** page, under **UM Mailbox Policies**, select the UM mailbox policy you want to manage, and then on the toolbar, click **Edit** ![Edit icon](../../media/ITPro_EAC_EditIcon.gif).
    
3. On the **UM Mailbox Policy** page, under **PIN polices**, clear the check box next to **Allow common PIN patterns**.
    
4. Click **Save**.
    
## Use Exchange Online PowerShell to disable common PIN patterns

This example prevents users associated with the UM mailbox policy named `MyUMMailboxPolicy` from using PINs that contain common patterns. 
  
```
Set-UMMailboxPolicy -Identity MyUMMailboxPolicy -AllowCommonPatterns $false
```
