# View a UM hunt group

When you view the properties for a Unified Messaging (UM) hunt group, you can view the properties associated with a single UM hunt group or with all UM hunt groups associated with a single UM IP gateway. If neither parameter is specified, all UM hunt groups will be returned. You can't use the EAC to view UM hunt group properties; you must use Exchange Online PowerShell.
  
After a UM hunt group has been created, the configured settings can't be changed. If you want to change a configuration setting such as the pilot identifier on a UM hunt group, you must delete the existing UM hunt group and create a new UM hunt group that has the correct settings. 
  
For additional tasks related to UM hunt groups, see [UM hunt group procedures](um-hunt-group-procedures.md).

## Use Exchange Online PowerShell to view the properties of a UM hunt group
