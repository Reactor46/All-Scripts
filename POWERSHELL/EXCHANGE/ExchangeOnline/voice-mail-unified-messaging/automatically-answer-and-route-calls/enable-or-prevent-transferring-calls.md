2. On the **UM Dial Plan** page, under **UM Auto Attendants**, select the UM auto attendant for which you want to configure call transfer, and then click **Edit** ![Edit icon](../../media/ITPro_EAC_EditIcon.gif).
    
3. On the **UM Auto Attendant** page \> **Address book and operator access**, under **Options for contacting users**, select the check box next to **Allow callers to dial users** to enable calls to be transferred. To prevent call transfers, clear the check box.
