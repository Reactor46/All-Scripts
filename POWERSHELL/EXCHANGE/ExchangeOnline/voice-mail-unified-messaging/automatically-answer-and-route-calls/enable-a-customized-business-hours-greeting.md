# Enable a customized business hours greeting

You can enable a customized business hours greeting for a Unified Messaging (UM) auto attendant. The business hours greeting is the first thing callers hear when a UM auto attendant answers their call during business hours. You'll probably want to customize the greeting.
  
 Unified Messaging includes a default system prompt for use during business hours. Although the default system prompt mustn't be replaced or changed, you may want to provide an customized greeting. You can create a customized greeting in the .wav or .wma file format to be used when callers call in to a UM auto attendant during business hours. For example, "You've reached Woodgrove Bank." 
  
If you want to include the name of your organization or business as part of the default greeting, you can enter the name in the **Business name** box on the UM auto attendant. For details, see [Enter a business name](enter-a-business-name.md).
  
For additional management tasks related to UM auto attendants, see [UM auto attendant procedures](um-auto-attendant-procedures.md).

## Use Exchange Online PowerShell to enable a customized business hours greeting

This example enables the business hours greeting that uses a customized greeting named `GreetingFile.wav` for the UM auto attendant `MyUMAutoAttendant`.
  
```
Set-UMAutoAttendant -Identity MyUMAutoAttendant -BusinessHoursWelcomeGreetingEnabled $true -BusinessHoursWelcomeGreetingFilename GreetingFile.wav
```

This example configures a UM auto attendant named `MyUMAutoAttendant` to have business hours configured to be 10:45 to 13:15 (Sunday), 09:00 to 17:00 (Monday), and 09:00 to 16:30 (Saturday) and holiday times and their associated greetings configured to be " `New Year`" on January 2, 2013, and " `Building Closed for Construction`" from April 24, 2013 through April 28, 2013.
  
```
Set-UMAutoAttendant -Identity MyUMAutoAttendant -BusinessHoursSchedule 0.10:45-0.13:15,1.09:00-1.17:00,6.09:00-6.16:30 -HolidaySchedule "New Year,newyrgrt.wav,1/2/2013","Building Closed for Construction,construction.wav,4/24/2013,4/28/2013"
```

This example configures a UM auto attendant named `MyAutoAttendant` and enables business hours key mappings so that when callers press 1, they're forwarded to another UM auto attendant named `SalesAutoAttendant`. When they press 2, they're forwarded to extension number 12345 for `Support`, and when they press 3, they're sent to another auto attendant that plays an audio file. 
  
```
Set-UMAutoAttendant -Identity MyAutoAttendant - BusinessHoursKeyMappingEnabled $true -BusinessHoursKeyMapping "1,Sales,,SalesAutoAttendant","2,Support,12345","3,Directions,,,directions.wav"
```
