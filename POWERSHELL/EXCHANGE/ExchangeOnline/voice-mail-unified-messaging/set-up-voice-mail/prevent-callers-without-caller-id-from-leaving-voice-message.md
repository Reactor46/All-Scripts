# Prevent callers without a caller ID from leaving a voice message

You can allow UM-enabled users to receive voice messages from anonymous callers or prevent them from doing so. By default, when users are enabled for Unified Messaging (UM) and voice mail, they can receive calls that are anonymous and don't contain caller ID information.
  
In most cases, calls received by Exchange servers contain a caller ID that can be used to determine the source of the incoming call. However, incoming calls may not include caller ID information for the following reasons:
  
- Your organization's telephony equipment is configured not to include caller ID information. 
    
- The incoming call is from a mobile or external telephone. 
    
- The caller has disabled caller ID on their telephone. 
    
Because the _AnonymousCallersCanLeaveMessages_ parameter is enabled by default, a UM-enabled user can receive a voice message even if caller ID information isn't included. If the _AnonymousCallersCanLeaveMessages_ option is disabled, and the UM-enabled user receives a call that doesn't include a caller ID, the call will be identified as anonymous, and the UM-enabled user won't receive a voice message. 
  
For additional management tasks related to users who are enabled for voice mail, see [Voice mail-enabled user procedures](voice-mail-enabled-user-procedures.md).

## Use Exchange Online PowerShell to prevent voice messages from anonymous callers from being received

This example prevents UM-enabled user tonysmith@contoso.com from receiving voice messages from calls that don't contain caller ID information.

```
