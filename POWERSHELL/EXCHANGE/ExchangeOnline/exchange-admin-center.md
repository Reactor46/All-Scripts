 **To bulk edit several items**: press the CTRL key, select the objects you want to bulk edit, and use the options in the details pane.

The Centers tile allows you to change from one admin center to another. The Me tile allows you to sign out of the EAC and sign in as a different user. From the Help ![Help Icon](media/ITPro_EAC_HelpIcon.gif) drop-down menu, you can perform the following actions: 
  
- **Help**: Click ![Help Icon](media/ITPro_EAC_HelpIcon.gif) to view the online help content.
