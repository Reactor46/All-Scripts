- This example modifies the sharing policy Contoso. This policy allows users in the Contoso domain to see simple free/busy information.
    
  ```
  Set-SharingPolicy -Identity Contoso -Domains 'sales.contoso.com: CalendarSharingFreeBusySimple'
  ```

- This example adds a second domain to the sharing policy Contoso. When you're adding a domain to an existing policy, you must include any previously included domains.
    
  ```
  Set-SharingPolicy -Identity Contoso -Domains 'contoso.com: CalendarSharingFreeBusySimple', 'atlanta.contoso.com: CalendarSharingFreeBusyReviewer', 'beijing.contoso.com: CalendarSharingFreeBusyReviewer'
  ```

- This example sets the sharing policy Contoso as the default sharing policy.
    
  ```
  Set-SharingPolicy -Identity Contoso -Default $True
  ```

- This example disables the sharing policy Contoso.
    
  ```
  Set-SharingPolicy -Identity "Contoso" -Enabled $False
  ```

- The first example removes the sharing policy Contoso. The second example removes the sharing policy Contoso and suppresses the confirmation that you want to remove the policy.
    
  ```
  Remove-SharingPolicy -Identity Contoso
  ```

  ```
  Remove-SharingPolicy -Identity Contoso -Confirm
  
  ```
