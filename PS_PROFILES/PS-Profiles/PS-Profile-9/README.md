# My-Powershell-Profiles 

Powershell Profiles for Powershell 5.0 and Powershell ISE. 

They contain color and console size configs (which can be customized to your liking). I've also included a script which adds the possibility to toggle comments on and off in Powershell ISE, as well as makes it possible to save the Powershell ISE session.
